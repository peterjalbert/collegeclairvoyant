Did not send 1st semester grade report in on time (straight As), but missing the deadline probably wasn't good.  Also, the essays could have used more work.

General Comments: This was the only "reach" school she applied to.  All the rest were matches and safeties and she has great scholarship offers from all of them.  We knew going in that Stanford is a long shot for anyone.  Happy to have had the chance to play the lottery.

Reflection 
Getting into the places I did was an extreme shock for me and I couldn't have imagined it in a million years. Though I have a tough decision to make, I'm extremely grateful for it. If you are unsure if you should apply, just go for it. If Stanford's your dream school and you get rejected, don't feel bad. You will succeed anywhere that you may go. In my case getting rejected from my dream school just led me to greater options.

General Comments: Stats of admitted students can't tell you anything other than that stats aren't everything (i must repeat: STATS AREN'T EVERYTHING). It's up to the admissions officers and what they want is anyone's guess so stressing about scores is absolutely the wrong thing to do. Just show yourself through your essays and do your best, but know that whatever happens it's up to you to make the best of the situation.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: letters of rec, extracurriculars 
Weaknesses: grades, test scores, essays 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Everyone who gets accepted to Stanford is extraordinary in some way. I think although my grades and scores weren't phenomenal they were good enough to demonstrate that I was a competent student that could survive at Stanford. So I'd say that I probably didn't have quite as spectacular achievements of most of the admits. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to Cornell, Rice and Rutgers honors college. 
Denied from: MIT, Princeton, Columbia, Penn, Northwestern, and UVA 
 
General Comments: 
Once you're qualified it takes a lot of luck. Unless you're a homerun applicant (recruited athlete, intel awards, first generation) you need to be very fortunate. I'm not bitter at all and I'm confident everyone who got in was well deserving of it. Congrats to everyone who got in.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Common App Essay: 9 
I wrote about my experience at NOAA, using the childhood to adulthood prompt. I talked about learning how to program independently and finding my love for the scientific method. I also made sure to emphasize my love for the process of learning, for knowledge itself. A bit cliche, but I think it did the job. 
 
Stanford Activity Essay: 9 
I wrote about my love for the peace and quiet of swimming. I think it stood out because it demonstrated that I don't only participate in academic activities, that I also love the teamwork and community of my sport. 
 
Stanford Intellectual Vitality Essay: 7 
I talked about the need to listen to different viewpoints, but I think it could have been misinterpreted after the election.  
 
Stanford Roommate Essay: 7 
I thought this essay was slightly generic; I just wrote about my various quirks and that I hoped we could accept each other. 
 
Stanford "What Matters to You?": 9 
I thought this essay was really good, as it explored my love for nature and my hope to make a difference in our changing climate. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 10- This was from my history teacher, and it was really good. I was the only student to receive a 7 on the IB test at my school, so he really made it count. 
Teacher Rec #2: 7- This was from my physics teacher, and it was slightly generic but still decent. 
Counselor Rec: 5- My school is giant, so the counselors don't really know the students... 
Additional Rec: 10- I was deferred to regular decision, so I got my chemistry teacher to write me an additional rec letter. I was his student aide, and we have a really good relationship, so I'm assuming that this really helped. 
Interview: 10- My interviewer asked me a lot about the research that I have done at NOAA, and we ended up talking for over an hour.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: I thought my essays were really good, as writing has always been one of my strengths. I think that they really conveyed my work ethic and my love for learning. In addition, my test scores are also pretty good. I also think that I presented a clear narrative through my activities-the environment, research about the environment at NOAA, yet that I also presented balance through my love for swimming. I also think that my rec letters were really good. 
Weaknesses: I haven't taken as many AP tests as a lot of people because of the IB Program. I also haven't done many academic competitions or held many leadership positions. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think that it probably came down to my essays, which I worked really hard on. I really felt that they represented who I am. I also emphasized the fact that I taught myself how to program and my initiative through my research at NOAA, which I think that they probably appreciated. I tried to present a coherent picture and to connect the dots in my application. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: 
Accepted: University of Michigan, Brown, Dartmouth, Middlebury, Carleton, Vanderbilt, Macalester, University of Washington 
Waitlisted: Williams 
Rejected: Harvard, Princeton, Pomona 
 
General Comments: 
Honestly, I think that this process is just a lottery. I'm still so shocked that I got in because I know that there are so many people who are more qualified that I am. College is what you make of it, so even if you didn't get in, there will still be so many opportunities. I am just so grateful for the one that has been given to me. Congratulations and good luck to everyone!

Reflection: I really beat myself up about the college application process. I feel like all I did for a year was read posts on college confidential, obsess about the 3's I had on AP's, the average class rank I had, and whether or not I was winning enough debate tournaments or entering enough writing/art contests. And I definitely had this whole misconception about how being asian meant I wouldn't get in anywhere. Getting deferred from Yale early crushed me, but it was good because I snapped back to reality and started focusing on doing the things I love again. In the end, it didn't even matter, and I got in regular decision after sending almost no updates to my original application. I'm still amazed that I get to go to my dream school, and it's a great feeling, but in the end, the whole process amounted to this one letter. And all I can say from the other side is that it's not worth beating yourself up for, because it will never define you. I always thought people who said 'you'll end up where you belong' where ridiculous optimists, but from the other side I can see that it's true. Colleges accept you based on how you'll fit on their campus, so an acceptance or denial is never a judge of worth, but rather a judge of applicability, and everything happens for the best. I'm just making this post because 1. I hope it reminds some people that you can get into an ivy or top ten school even if you're an asian with imperfect stats 2. these posts were a guide for me 3. if you're genuinely passionate about something, let it shine through 
Strengths: Debate accomplishments, passion for feminism 
Weaknesses: Rank, SAT II, and AP scores 
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think I was accepted because it was clear that I only did things I was really deeply passionate about 
Where else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Accepted to Yale, Brown, Cornell, Duke (AB full scholarship), Emory (full scholarship); Waitlisted at Harvard and Columbia, Rejected at Princeton

                              Your stats are very near perfect, way better than my kid's. In the same intended major also. Why did you apply Yale early when Stanford was your number one choice?  Getting 770 in SAT II and one or two 3s in AP is not bad at all. IMO your getting into Stanford and Yale is not at all surprising.                                   
~~~~~

                            ^ Agree with above.  Was also an AB Duke scholar, which is even more selective.  6/400 hardly qualifies as "average class rank".                                  
~~~~~

                              All I gotta say is that if the above stats are "not nearly perfect", my kid's stats are not worthy of even applying to HYPSM.     My kid was very happy when he got around 750 in the same SAT subject tests.  He has mostly 4 and 3s, except 5 on English language AP tests.

Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Pianist (13 years, performed three times with local orchestras, won multiple competitions, etc), Flutist (principal in band and youth symphony, school drum major, winner of many competitions), Board Member of my school district, school newspaper (editor-in-chief), school yearbook (copy editor)

Volunteer/Community service: 500+ hours of service at a local cancer center 
Summer Activities: Cancer center volunteering, Northwestern CTD (6 years), Brevard Music Center 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): I think my essays were what got me in. Probably an 8 for my common app essay though- it was a bit cliche. My supplement essays for Stanford were really true to myself and witty, so I think that's what helped me the most. (I wrote about Harry Potter) 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): I didn't get to read two of them, but they were teachers who liked me a lot. The one I did read was a solid 10. She wrote a lot and made me seem like a god or something lol 
 
Teacher Rec #1: Chem teacher 
Teacher Rec #2: English teacher 
Counselor Rec: She was an English teacher who really liked me, so I'd assume it was pretty nice. 
Additional Rec: No other additional red 
Interview: My interview actually went kinda bleh. The guy was a very serious lawyer-type person, and although I indicated I was interested in pre-law, he was unfazed. He kept asking me questions I had no answers for or other things that I hadn't prepared for. That being said, he sent me an email once I got in and said some really nice things to me. You never know!

Reflection 
 
Strengths: I think it was my essays, for sure. At every other college, I tried super hard to be formal and deep and meaningful, but I just let loose with my Stanford essays. They were bold and risky, but were the best reflection of my true self. 
Weaknesses: Test scores, haven't rid the world of cancer yet 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: It's probably the essays, again. They don't accept many kids from my area to the school, and they hadn't in six years... so that helped. I think I just presented myself in a very truthful way and that resonated well with my reader. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted at Duke, Swarthmore, WashU, Middlebury, Emory, and U of I. Waitlisted at Harvard, Penn, Brown, Cornell, Columbia, Amherst, Williams, Georgetown, Tufts. Rejected at Princeton, Yale, and Dartmouth. 
 
General Comments: Look, I'm shocked I got in. After a metric buttload of waitlists the day before, I was sure Stanford was out. But, I think if you apply to Stanford with a certain mindset and approach the application with your best intentions in mind, it'll pull through. Stanford was not my dream school because I never though I'd get in.. but here we are   Good luck to any future applicants!!

Teacher Rec #1: 7, I didn't read it.  I'm not sure if it was a 7, could be worse or better.  I know the teacher likes me and they are a good writer. The college information person at my school liked it. 
Teacher Rec #2: 7, I didn't read it either, so I'm not sure about my rating.  I know the teacher loves me.  College information person at my school liked it.  This teacher was my sophomore teacher, and that could have hurt me, but you can never tell with these things.  She got two people in the past two years to Princeton and Yale.  She was the sophomore teacher of the one who went to Princeton. 
Counselor Rec: 7, he was really excited about his letter, so I'm sure he did a good job.  I didn't read it though.  The college information person at my school liked this too. 
Additional Rec: 9, this guy was a retired economics teacher who taught me economics outside of school.  His letter had a few typos because they escaped him, but the content put me in a really good light as somebody who went out of their way to learn more.

Reflection 
Strengths: Good ACT score, good GPA & transcript 
Weaknesses: No SAT IIs, Activities not focused on leadership 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Combination of lack of SAT II, activities, and possibly my recs (although I don't think they were negative). Also, this is my Post-Graduate year because I started high school early. I also had to leave the country in my junior year because my grandmother, who lives in India became ill.. So some disruption in my education. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Applied to UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, UCI, and UCD. 
Also applying to Harvard, UPenn, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, Rice, Vanderbilt, Duke, Yale, NYU, and UChicago 
 
General Comments: 
I'm kinda relieved. I'm glad it's not a deferral and I'm just going to focus on my other first choice tie. Now, time to try and get into Harvard...

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Maybe SAT and GPA? I didn't think I had particular strengths 
Weaknesses: ECs definitely, lack of any outstanding details 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: My scores, grades, and recs were probably seen well, but they wanted to compare me with the regular decision applicants who will most likely outshine me with ECs/awards 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere yet! 
 
General Comments: At first I was really upset, the first sentence of the deferral is "We appreciate the thoughtfulness and hard work you put into your application and acknowledge your strong interest in Stanford as a Restrictive Early Action applicant." I thought I was rejected, then found out I got deferred and felt a little better. Now I'm actually kind of happy! By the time I get my regular round decision, I'll probably be accepted somewhere else that's awesome, so a rejection won't hurt as much then...

Job/Work Experience: Small online business 
Volunteer/Community service: 48 hours at a children's summer camp, a couple hours here and there from NHS 
Summer Activities: Does traveling count? I didn't really participate in any programs. 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): My common app was brilliant, 10/10. Roommate essay was unlike anything I've written before and I liked it a lot 10/10. Intellectual vitality was maybe an 8/10, and the what matters to me was a 7/10. The last two definitely could have been stronger... 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 11/10 She was my AP Lang teacher and wrote amazing things about me, she said things along the lines of "never had a student who has impacted the way I teach so much," and "student was vital to success of other students." Gave me goosebumps (she let me read it at her own discretion because she was very proud of it). 
Teacher Rec #2: 8/10 General, I got it from my physics teacher who liked me as a student. He pretty much wrote general things. 
Counselor Rec: 5/10 I'm assuming very generic. 
Additional Rec: 11/10 My Model UN adviser. He wrote a fantastic recommendation letter about my speaking skills and abilities as a student. I was thoroughly impressed and shocked with some of the things he had to say about me.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: My essays, standardized test scores 
Weaknesses: Extracurriculars were generic and made me wish I had more accomplishments in high school. My AP scores were also poor in some areas, and I wish I took the time to explain in the additional comments section why. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Honestly, it's Stanford. You can't really expect much from a school with a five percent acceptance rate. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nothing yet. It was restricted early action after all. 
 
General Comments: I'm a little disappointed, but I kinda expected it. I still hung on to that little sliver of hope until the end. But I'm a firm believer in that everything happens for a reason, and if it takes getting rejected from Stanford and getting accepted into a school I meant to go to, then so be it. I can honestly say I'm glad I gave it my all and tried, and I'm eager to find out where it is I'll be spending my next four years at. Congratulations to those that got in, and to those of you who may be reading this as a reference for the future, I come bearing one piece of advice: a college education is what you make of it, and a college doesn't define you. Everyone has in it in their ability to find success, and I'm 100% certain we will all find our little place to achieve just that.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): First-generation college student 
 
Reflection 
 
Strengths: I had overcome a lot of obstacles, yet still managed to get pretty stellar grades and had great extra curriculars. I have done a lot to improve my community and have shown dedication. 
Weaknesses: My SAT scores and GPA are not as great as others on here. I thought that would keep me from getting in and was honestly hoping for a deferral. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Pitzer College and Claremont Makenna. Pitzer flew me out and interviewed me and offered me admission on the spot. Pomona and CMC also asked to borrow me and interviewed as well and CMC offered me admission a few days later. 
 
General Comments: 
Scores and numbers are not everything! Do not let those things keep you from applying anywhere. I almost didn't apply because I was 99% sure I would not get in and it would've broken my heart. Although I later realized that I would be ok with getting rejected, I got in despite my numbers. You miss 100% of all shots you don't take. 
Also, I'm kind of still freaking out that i got in so I probably forgot a few things and I apologize for the poor grammar. Please let me know if you'd like to ask me anything!

Strengths: good ACT, AP scores. 
Weaknesses: one of my SATs was a 2200, not sure how they look at those. Nothing to really set me apart from everyone else. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I thought my overall application was pretty good, but I'm thinking it might've been the essays or the recommendations, since I feel like my numbers and extracurriculars were strong 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: applied to Berkeley, UMich, Harvard and more soon. 
 
General Comments: 
Of course I'm disappointed to not get in, but also not being outright rejected is an accomplishment in itself. With a better chance of getting in during regular admission, I'll stay optimistic, even if I am a little frustrated at the lack of a definite answer.

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: none yet fingers crossed! 
 
Note: Stanfrod EA has the lowest acceptance rate by far out of any University (even Harvard has 14% or something like that). To those of you who made it, CONGRATULATIONS! And to people like me, just know that one day you will probably be thankful that you didn't go to Stanford because the friends you will meet in college would not have known you if you had gone to Stanford. Also, you miss 100% of the chances you don't take so I think it was a great learning experience.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
Roommate: Very quirky, I talked about how I love puns and told a story about how I made a pun about mayonnaise, and ended saying "Don't worry, I'll make sure to ketchup on my puns, I only hope you'll have mustard the courage to relish them by the time we meet." 10 if they love silly jokes like the kind I make, probably a lot worse if they don't. 
Long essay: I'd say a solid 8-9. Talked about how I have severe eczema and basically how that's prevented me from doing a lot of stuff with my life, but it also allowed me to discover what I love to do and am good at doing. The teacher who read over my essays said it was really good, and she was my ap lang teacher. 
What matters: Probably a 6. I kinda rehashed the whole "I love to learn" thing that I talked about in my vitality essay, which I think I wrote better. This one talked about how I always ask questions. 
Vitality: Maybe a 7-8? Better than my what matters essay (as I said). I talked about how I have never won anything in the Academic Decathlon yet but I keep trying. 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):

Additional Rec: From my piano teacher for an arts supplement, didn't read.

Applied for Financial Aid?: Yes 
Intended Major: CS + Classics 
State (if domestic applicant): CA 
Country (if international applicant): 
School Type: Public 
Ethnicity: White (European) 
Gender: Female 
Income Bracket: 80,000-90,000 
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): I asked a Stanford representative and they said it wasn't a hook, but I am a female going into a scientific career. 
 
Reflection 
 
Strengths: 
Weaknesses: Low SAT. Never did anything spectacular. Am from a small school in CA where what I have done is considered pretty great, but in comparison to places with more opportunities, I haven't done much, so I'm not an impressive applicant. 
Why you think you were rejected: Not good enough for Stanford, in the end. Too much going against me, too many other applicants who I guess were better. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I applied REA so I won't know any other college decisions until I find out about SJSU in late February. 
 
General Comments: 
I expected as much, with the low acceptance rate at all, but it still hurt a lot to know all my dreams of joint majoring and all that were crushed. I decided if I didn't get into Stanford that I'd apply to Santa Clara University in hopes of getting a good merit scholarship from them (as a replacement for good financial aid I could have gotten from Stanford). Congratulations to everyone out there who got in, because I'm sure that in the end, you deserved it, and I hope you can all do great things with your life. 
For me, though, it's time to move on. 
 
EDIT: I accidentally typed 2141 for my SAT superscore instead of 2140 somehow, whoops! 
EDIT 2: After putting so much of my knowledge of myself into college apps, I've forgotten what I've done. Added two awards (they're not super big but one is a state award and another is national, so yeah). I hope I haven't forgotten anything else XD

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10/10 Frankly, I think I was able to compile my ideas very well, and managed to get across a important points about my hopes goals as well as my general outlook on academics and extracurricular activities. Although I wrote a initial drafts, I didn't put in an insane amount of time into them, but I tried to be as sincere and true to myself as possible, guess Stanford liked that. 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 10/10 both, I greatly enjoy actually talking with my teachers and have always been that way for some reason. As a result, they got to know me very well and I think they were very honest about who I am and what I would do with a college education. 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10 
Teacher Rec #2: 10/10

Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App Essay 9: super powerful and shows my struggle to find an identity, Intellectual Vitality 8: shows how i came to accept the fact of failure; Roommate 7/8: not as seriously written, but shows my quirky side that is not seen elsewhere in app; Life essay (or whatever it is called) 7: still strong and about my love for Spanish, but not as strong as the others

Reflection 
 
Strengths: IMO, the strongest part was the entire MITES experience (wrote an essay on it, got a research opportunity, and got amazing rec letter) and how I showcased my passions in my essays; I recommend brainstorming the point you are trying to get across with your application (ie- a girl trying to escape the binds of a patriarchal society, a boy trying to escape the endless cycle of crime in his neighborhood, a kid with a love for the things unknown, etc.) and try to weave this idea across your app. 
Weaknesses: SAT II scores, some AP scores, Interview beginning, my Spanish essay could've been brushed up 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I believe I conveyed my aspirations and beliefs across the entire app so that the admit team had a clear idea of who I am 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Well it is still early so not that many; University of Texas, Colorado School of Mines, OU 
 
General Comments: Good luck to all of you future applicants! Let your light shine and do not be bashful in your applications! For those of you who were deferred or rejected, do not lose hope! Do not let one decision rule your life and continue to change the world around you.

Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Varsity Volleyball (Captain), Club Volleyball (Captain), Competitive Piano, FBLA, Science Olympiad (Vice President), French Club (Vice President), Cultural Cuisines for a Cause (Co-President), National Honors Society (Warden of Character) 
 
 
Job/Work Experience: I worked at a private biotech company where we synthesized monoclonal antibodies for cancer research. 
 
 
Volunteer/Community service: I volunteer at my local hospital and volunteer through National Honor Society. I'm also working to raise money for the Maryland Food Bank and our local Grassroots Shelter through Cultural Cuisines for a Cause. 
 
 
Summer Activities: 
I did two different internships, one at George Mason University and one in a private biotech company. Also, lots and lots of working out to prepare for volleyball season. 
 
 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
I0/10 - I really poured my heart out in every single one of my essays, even the short answers. In my common app, I wrote about tearing my ACL and my journey of coming back to play volleyball; for the shorter essays, I highlighted my experiences playing piano and volunteering at the local hospital. But, my favorite short essay was by far my roommate one. It was really creative - I talked about how I'm really tall and could make you uncomfortable as my roommate, but I'm also tall in terms of character and whatnot. Sounds a bit cheesy, but I made it pretty witty and it really sounds like my voice. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
Teacher Rec #1: Didn't read any of my teacher recommendations, but one was from my AP Biology teacher, who's known me for a while and has also seen my recovery from my ACL tear and has come to some of my volleyball games. My other teacher was my French teacher, who had also wrote my sister's recommendation (she goes to Duke). She was definitely the teacher I was closest to and knew me the best, not just in class but overall as a person. So I'd give my recs a 9.5/10 
Teacher Rec #2: See above 
Counselor Rec: Didn't read it, but she knew me pretty well, which is surprising because at my school, a lot of students don't have a close relationship with their counselor. 9/10 
Additional Rec: 
Internship Mentor - my mentor at George Mason University wrote one for me and it highlighted our research and our plans for a paper and a future company. 10/10 
Piano Teacher - I submitted an art supplement, so my piano teacher was required to write a letter for me. It was honestly the nicest thing anyone has ever said about me. I've been with my piano teacher for 13 years now and she's practically like a second mom. 10/10 
 
Interview: Went really well! I was paired up with a doctor at John Hopkins University. He was extremely nice and we had a great conversation. However, I've heard that the interview is mainly to check to make sure you're not crazy or something, so I don't know how much it actually contributed to my overall application.

Weaknesses: If anything, my rank could have been a bit higher. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think it was mainly because I'm pretty well-rounded and in my application, I tried really hard to sound like a human being, not just another applicant in a pool of extremely qualified students. 
 
 
General Comments: Even if you were waitlisted, deferred, or rejected, remember that you are still awesome! You had the guts to apply to the most selective university in the nation. Don't give up, you will all end up somewhere fabulous.

Recommender #2: 7.5/10 Basketball Couch and English Teacher, He really like me and we have a good relationship, but he showed me the essay and it seemed fairly generic 
Recommender #3: ?/10 I haven't seen it. He was my science bowl coach and we have a good relationship, so I figure it was decent if he can write.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Weighted GPA, National Science Bowl, Continuity in Latin, Recommendation #1 
Weaknesses: SAT/ACT, Unweighted GPA, Awards, Community Service, Work Experience, 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: My scores are lower for Stanford, I'm pretty lazy so that lead me to a few B's in high school and I got another because my Uncle died before Finals last year, I don't really have any hooks and I don't think that my essays were probably very good, Not to mention that Stanford is kind of a crapshoot even if you're the most talented person on the planet. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Stanford is my first to hear from obviously, but I'm waiting to hear back from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UCSD, UCSB, UCSC, UC Davis, Yale, Harvard, Columbia, NYU, Johns Hopkins, and Humboldt State 
 
General Comments: I didn't really expect to get in and I'm not really that upset about it, but I'd be lying if I said that it wasn't disappointing, because I know that I'm a better applicant than my application shows, granted everybody probably feels like that and plenty of people far more qualified than me are probably receiving their rejections right now. To everybody that got in, good for you and have a great time at Stanford. To everybody that didn't, this isn't the end wherever you get in you are going to have an incredible time in college and in a few years you probably won't even care that you didn't get in. Now Berkeley is my #1 and I feel like I have a decent chance of getting in, UCLA would be cool too. Best of Luck to Everybody.

Summer Activities: Spent the summer volunteering at the elementary, and went to Cuba to see my family for a month after two years of not seeing them. 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Probably a 9/10. On my Common App I talked about how immigrating marked my transition into young adulthood. The roommate one I talked about my usual things like how I listen to classical music but sing a combination of old Cuban boleros and today's hits. The intellectual vitality I wrote about gaining confidence back through the tutoring program, and for the what matters to you and why I wrote about education and how it helps me develop my own identity and position.

Teacher Rec #1:8/10, Spanish professor at the university where I do Dual Enrollment at. He said that I was one of the best students he had on 35 years of teaching.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: My essays were all about me, me and me. My English teacher told me that my essay had to be one that anyone could recognize as mine instantly. My recommenders were strong. ECs were strong as well. I had also done about 30 credits in Dual Enrollment, and I sent my transcripts from the College. 
Weaknesses: I don't think my scores were high enough, but I was tired of testing. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think I got accepted because in my essays I tried to incorporate who I was while adding all the aspects of my culture and my unique immigration experience. I did all of this avoiding a sob story because I didn't want have the admissions committee pity me, but see that I was stronger because of my experiences. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I have been accepted at FIU (where I do dual enrollment), and I haven't applied nowhere else for now. 
 
General Comments: I am extremely surprised and I had to have more than three people confirm that I was reading right. Nevertheless I think there are people more qualified than me. 
If you are reading this before applying or after applying, please don't lose all hope because I had lost all of mine. It is not all about test grades and GPA, but who you are as a person, and I think that was my strength.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
Personal Statement: 9; I really liked my essay, but I honestly thought they would see it as being super cheesy, because it was focusing on my status as an immigrant. I had a whole Newton's First Law angle and said that the force that guided me throughout the variables in my life was math. 
Short Essay #1: 9; for the intellectual vitality question, I focused on graphic design and how I it was an exploration of both my identity as well as the person I was creating it for. I liked the idea but again, super cheesy (cringe-worthy honestly). 
Short Essay #2: 8; the letter to the roommate was very standard. Didn't try to be unique or weird; I just went for it and wrote an honest-to-god note, and I thought it was pretty good. 
Short Essay #3: 10; I wrote about my Mickey ears collection and how Disneyland was basically what I strove to achieve in preserving happiness and stuff. It turned out pretty well and was my favorite of the three I wrote. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
Teacher Rec #1: 10; I adore my math teacher/CSF advisor, and I really think it was her recommendation that pushed me over the top to becoming accepted. 
Teacher Rec #2: 10; my Junior English teacher is such a crack-up with her dry humor, and I think I left a good impression in her class because I was always super engaged and out there. 
Counselor Rec: 10; my AP Euro teacher wrote it since he's also our counselor and IB Coordinator, and he's a terrific teacher that I truly admire. 
Additional Rec: 10; my MUN advisor is super awesome (we love to share our love for musical theater), and I think she probably talked about the stuff I've contributed to our yearly MUN conference.

General Comments: Don't give up! My extracurriculars were fairly standard and local in scope; I was afraid I would be too small to be considered, and yet here I am.

Additional Rec: I legitimately think this pushed me over the edge into an acceptance. I read it after-the-fact because she was re-using it for a conference award and needed a proof-reader (English not her 1st language) and it was the most kind words anyone has ever used to describe me. I mean, I was tearing up a bit and she actually felt that it wasn't good it enough. Even if she spelled my name wrong, itt was more than good enough: it was amazing.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Besides being a competitive applicant in numerical terms, I think it came down to my essays. I made sure to showcase a different bit of myself in each one. My "What Matters to You" was my activist, would-be professor side: the impactful person I would like to be one day. My "Roommate" essay was silly, nerdy, and straight-up punny. I wrote about CS:GO and watching anime; cooking and listening to K-pop. I was discouraged by people because it was "too casual", but that's what I wanted. I wanted to show them who I was outside of school, and how even there I have an eclectic and open-minded range of interests. I'm a person: a wacky, silly, nerdy person; to portray myself otherwise in my roommate essay would be to lie. Chatting with the other matches, this casual theme seemed to be what everyone who was matched did. I don't think that's a coincidence. I focused on my research for "Intellectual Vitality" and how I engaged my project from early one and developed a method for understanding academia and the scientific method. However, I made sure that voice from my roommate carried on in how I felt the first time I had to read an academic paper, e.g.: how I first dreaded reading them, but later started reading them for fun of all things. My QB essays also added depth, but those are a bit too long to  break down here; anyone in the QB Facebook group can see my analysis of my extended 800 word essay. 
 
Weaknesses: Community service felt weak post-10th grade. My Math II could have been a higher percentile. Physics experience is very lacking (basic physics, no AP or physics + calc). 
 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Everyone posting here is competitive, so that's a given. I'd say what distinguished me was QB status as a low-income minority + my essays, LoRs, and extensive research. 
 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: FIU. Didn't match MIT or Yale, but I'm not too devastated lol.

Summer Activities: Community college, saved up babysitting earnings and attended nanoscience camp at UCLA 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): I honestly poured my soul into my essays; I worked on them for over three months! I know they are well-written, because I asked people I really respect to critique the heck out of them until I was positive they were perfect. Honestly,given the effort I put into them, I may be somewhat biased, but I would rate them a 10. 
Teacher Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Asked two teachers and one teacher/club advisor/coach; I have a great relationship with all three of them and I know they did a good job. 
Counselor Rec: He he he, pretty sure it was generic and short; new counselor this year and has hundreds of other students

Possibly a mistake, but one I don't regret; I'm still proud of what I wrote and think it showed my personality perfectly. Essay recycling time for my other apps!  
 
Reflection 
 
Strengths: Essays 
Weaknesses: Nothing super-impressive--no major awards, no research/publications; good but not amazing test scores 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Because it's Stanford!!!! I'm pretty disappointed, but I was preparing for this result. It's been a roller coaster of a week; I've ended up with stitches and physical therapy for two unrelated injuries (I think the nerves of waiting for this decision exponentially increased my already high level of clumsiness!), and this rejection didn't make things any better. I keep reminding myself this decision doesn't define my future success, and how proud I am that I not only will be attending college, but that I have stats high enough to even make an attempt that was only mostly--not entirely--impossible. 
To all my fellow denied students, this is simply one closed door out of many; I'm positive we all have bright futures ahead of us! 
To those accepted, congrats! Maybe I'll have the opportunity to join you at Stanford for grad school!  
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Won't hear from any other schools until spring

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10, I put my soul into this one.  I don't want to sound like I'm bragging but everyone who read it said it was one of the best essays they have read (Common App). The Supplement essays were also very strong and I believe I was effective in showing Stanford that I had an intellectual curiosity like no other. 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1:10, teacher loved me.  Told me she would do her best to make me stand out

General Comments: Those who prepared for Stanford will get in. Those who follow their passions and show that to Stanford will get in. You may question my statement of "will" but passion for learning will get you anywhere.

Senior Year Course Load: AP European History, AP English Literature, AP Physics C, AP Statistics, post-AP maths course, and some other electives 
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): HiMCM Outstanding, AP Scholar with Distinction / AP International Diploma, invited for AIME, gold medals for international martial arts competitions, gold awards for international orchestra competitions, among others, anyway. 
 
 
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Technology/IT/Programming Team (Leader), Heifer International (Leader), Quiz Bowl Club (founder/leader and kickstarted quizbowls in the region), Public Speaking Club (Team member), Orchestra (Section leader), also doing marital arts since I was young. 
Job/Work Experience: Previously did an internship at a video game company in South Korea. Currently working with the school to develop an e-commerce store.

Summer Activities: Did the internship, martial arts competition, programming sites and video games in my free time. 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Wrote a ton about making video games. Not sure if that's a plus or a minus. 
 
Teacher Rec #1: There is no score because I haven't read it. The teacher knew me quite well due to being in the same class and clubs, and was teaching the subject I wanted to major in. 
Teacher Rec #2: Pretty much the same as above, but for English. 
Counselor Rec: Counselor knows me very well, so I imagine this being pretty decent.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Awards, I suppose. 
 
 
Strengths: Generally speaking, everything "objective" has been solid and everything "subjective" has been half-decent as well (not perfect, but admittedly, half-decent.) 
Weaknesses: It's pretty simple. Stanford is looking for a specific kind of person, with the right personality and frame of mind, the right interests, the right ethnicity, etc. Unfortunately, I did not fit into that specific type of person. Grades and awards and clubs aren't going to save that. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: See weaknesses 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Did the interview recently for Oxford, we'll see how that goes... 
 
General Comments: Personally, I didn't really have the "world tumbling down" phenomena as others did. I just thought "eh," and now I'm writing supplements for regular decision. I guess I knew from the beginning that Stanford was a bit too high of a reach.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 9/10. On my Common App I talked about sports and how they've shaped me into the person I am today. It was pretty good and I worked on it since summer. The roommate one I talked about pokemon. Not kidding. The intellectual vitality I wrote about camp and how I was able to do whatever I had my mind set on and how at the end of the summer I had mastered something I had previously wanted. I think this was kinda lameish and the one I least worked on.  What matters to you and why I talked about the impact education has in the poor country I live in and how grateful I am that I can go to school everyday. 
 
 
 
Teacher Rec #1:my math teacher. It was really good. Nothing generic. She talked about me being the best student she's ever taught. 10/10 
Teacher Rec #2:history teacher. We got along really well, but I didn't read it. I'm guessing it was pretty good.

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Meh, I don't think I'll apply anywhere else. Stanford was my dream school and I got in. Maybeee Harvard and Yale if I can get myself to write more essays.

Intellectual Vitality - 8.5/10: wrote about how I was never all that into math until I interned at a math-based startup that changed my perspective of math (spend a lot of time on this essay, because it is the most important of the 3!!!) 
What Matters - 8.5/10: used David & Goliath metaphor (along with a personal anecdote) to show how I always stand up for what I believe in (sounds more generic than it was lol)

Strengths: ACT, legacy, certain essays, courseload 
Weaknesses: ECs, rec letters (for the most part), no major awards 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I really don't know. I still have a hard time believing it. It obviously helps that my dad & grandparents went, and that I have a sister there right now, but I think I highlighted the aspects of me that Stanford wants to see in my essays. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: nowhere, because Stanford was the first place I found out about and I will be pulling the rest of my applications. 
 
General Comments: 
 
Stanford has been my dream school for probably around 10 years now, and I am honored to be given the opportunity to attend. For all those of you applying next year, especially if you don't think you have a chance, just put your heart and soul into your application and let itself work out. Also, a word of advice: DO NOT procrastinate on your essays. If you write them in a day, I promise you they will not be Stanford-worthy essays.

General Comments: 
If you're the kind of person who is already a deep thinker (and I mean a deep deep thinker-- someone who can spur up epiphanies on-demand because their brain has enough horsepower), then you should find comfort in knowing that Stanford likes us.

Intellectual Vitality: 9/10 - Talked about my experience as a mime. 
Letter to roommate: 9/10 - Quite fun and unusual - sometimes funny. Some references to my favorite things about Stanford. 
What Matters: 8.5/10 - Talked about the philosophical questions that matter to me and how I attempt to answer them in every walk of life. 
Activities: 7/10 - Calligraphy and writing letters. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): I did not read the teachers' and the counselor's, but based on my conversations with them: 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 9/10 Liked me a lot. 
Teacher Rec #2: 10/10 Said he thought I was the best student he's ever had. 
Counselor Rec: 9/10 
Additional Rec: 9.5/10 The person who wrote it was a Philosophy professor at Stanford (he had taught me in the summer). He quite liked me and wrote very well. 
Interview: It was overall pretty good. She seemed very impressed and intrigued. The only thing I probably did not convey well was my depth of commitment to a particular field.

General Comments: 
I am very disappointed in this result. I do not know what I did wrong. My essays were quite different and good, and I honestly believe I'm a good match for this school (based on my 8 weeks there). I guess everybody cannot be at Stanford after all.

General Comments: 
I was disappointed and honestly surprised that no one else in my school made it in early, we normally get 2 spots REA. Come RD, though we'll like get a couple of people in who don't even have it as their top choice. Ugh. 
 
I don't really want to bring this up or consider this, but the kids from my school who've gotten in in the past have always either been low income or Hispanic, and everyone who applied REA this year was white and upper middle/high income. Just observations noted. 
 
I mostly wish I wouldn't have invested so much of myself into Stanford, it just made the rejection harder to take.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Definitely my essays, additional information section, recommendations, work experience, 
Weaknesses: SAT scores could have been much higher, lack of major awards 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I really think it was my essays.  I took three months to write these essays because I had writer's block for the longest time.  I think that my love of English set me apart from a sea of engineering/science majors. 
Where else you applied: Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Swarthmore, Washington and Lee, California University of Pennsylvania 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: California University of Pennsylvania 
General Comments: Just like many others who were accepted, I honestly was flabbergasted.  I fell to the floor and cried for five minutes straight.  Congratulations to everyone who was accepted!  I hope to meet you all in the future!  To those who were deferred, good luck!  I really hope every one of you gets in    To those who were denied, please don't be too hard on yourselves.  There are so many other places in the world to be!  You all will do amazingly at other fabulous universities!  To future applicants, I have one piece of advice I learned from my English teacher:  don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Stanford is an amazing place to go, but have some other potential Stanfords on your list as backups.

Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 10, from my advisor and english teacher at school. she's basically my best friend even though she's a teacher and she's like my second mom. waived right to view but she told me a bit about it and it sounded very good. she's also known me for 4 years. 
Teacher Rec #2: 10, from my history teacher. he's been a mentor to me for all of high school and he's an amazing writer. we had a rough start and then became close and developed a sense of respect for each other, so its a different opinion and a good way to see how I relate to teachers. 
Counselor Rec: 10 or 9, my graduating class only has 26 kids and she knows me pretty well. I talked with her a lot about applying. 
Additional Rec: 10, from my Anatomy & Physiology coach. she's known me for six years and has basically watched me grow into the person I am today. she's also the reason I want to become a doctor and we are very close, she probably knows me better than anyone else I got recommendations from. 
Interview: 10, we talked for longer than expected and had a lot in common. she said i was a fit for the university

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: No idea. Maybe it was the SAT stuff but honestly aside from that maybe it was just that I didn't have something absolutely outstanding like special circumstances or a business or had already made a name for myself in the world 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Only heard back from College of Charleston (accepted), also applied to Wake Forest University, UVA, Davidson College, (after rejected from Stanford) Harvard, (after rejected from Stanford) UNC Chapel Hill 
 
General Comments: If you apply to Stanford don't let anyone know. I had everyone at school know and they all thought that there was no way I would be rejected. I feel like I've let them all down and now I have to tell everyone I didn't get in, it's absolutely awful. Also try not to be too hopeful about places with such a low acceptance rate, it will feel horrible if you're rejected.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10/10. If I had a ticket into Stanford I knew it would have to be my essays. I am a writer so I pride myself on my writing.I knew this was my one hope. I polished these babies till I shone. I opted for "funny" for all of them. I didn't really try to impress rather than entertain, entertain, entertain. So they were all purely joke-based, casual, personable. I think they were taken aback by that, and this is what got me in. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 8.5/10? My English teacher. She didn't like me at first but by the end of the year I'd say we were tight. Tight enough for me to ask her to write my letter, at least. I also did some extra work for her (helped her plan some classes, performed in a fundraiser she organized, etc.) 
Teacher Rec #2: 8.5/10? My French teacher. I've had her for three years. I didn't participate much in her class the last year. Not sure if that made that onto the letter. But she is very nice so I'm sure the letter wasn't very negative. Also, I was homecoming queen and I got her to mention that in the rec letter so maybe that helped me. 
Counselor Rec: Maybe 6/10, maybe 9/10. He likes me, but he likes all the kids. I can't tell if he would go out of his way to write me a non-generic one or not. 
Additional Rec: 8.5/10 My writing teacher from Iowa Young Writers Studio. She is accomplished (New York Times, Paris Review) and I participated a lot in her class.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: see: strengths. 
 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: nowhere else yet 
 
General Comments: 
thrilled, stunned, and blessed. don't give up! Stanford only accepts 1% of students with GPAs under 3.7. If you play your cards right you can be in that 1% with me. 
 
market yourself smartly. try to find an angle and cast yourself in that angle and drive that point home. If you're good at art (even if you don't identify as purely 'artsy,') drive home the message: i'm artsy. i'm artsy. i'm artsy. that gives the officers almost a "tag line" to remember you by, and also it makes you seem like you have a very strong identity. 
I tried to market myself as witty and creative. I think that's what got me in. 
 
five other students from my school applied, however, and were rejected. all of them are as or more academically qualified than me, with stellar extracurriculars. just because you don't get in doesn't mean you aren't smart or capable or won't love the college you attend! 
 
i can't believe I almost applied Early Decision to Brown. I was so close! dodged a bullet there.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10. Seriously. Writing is what I do best, and literally every friend and teacher I talked to thought my essays were absolutely great. My personal statement was incredibly unorthodox, as were my supplemental essays. These certainly had a positive impact on my candidacy. 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: English teacher, didn't see. Did great in his class, but he didn't know me personally -- something that I regret in hindsight. Welp, it's just not my style. 
Teacher Rec #2: Physics teacher, didn't see. Same blurb as above^ 
Counselor Rec: Again, didn't see. I got to know him pretty well though, and he saw lots of my writing and knew what made me tick. 
Additional Rec: noperoni 
Interview: Thought it went great, but then again, I thought I had a chance at getting in (hahaaa). It was scheduled for 45 mins, went 80 mins. She laughed at my jokes, appeared to like me, etc. In the end, I don't think interviews actually matter though.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Test scores, essays. 
Weaknesses: No "passion" with ECs, maybe recs? 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Simple  -- it's not about academics anymore at these top schools. Literally, there's a bar of achievement you need to cross to not get thrown in the rejection pile right away, then it's all down to your ECs, essays, LOR, and, in some cases, your race and socioeconomic standing. They're not interested in building the best academic community, but the best community (as a Platonic ideal for them -- ethnic diversity, quirky personalities and talents, etc.) filled with kids who happen to be very smart. But it's nowhere near a meritocracy. And, to be honest, I respect that. They saw that, if you took away my scores and essays, I didn't have much to offer. They saw that I didn't have a passion, or something that I was really good at and dedicated to. Point is, if they encounter two applicants -- one with a 2400 and good grades but no clear passion or extraordinary talent and one with a 2250 and good grades with a clear passion and extraordinary talent in that field -- Stanford will take the latter applicant every time. Every time. I heard that many times, and only after seeing the rejection letter did it finally ring true. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Only applied to Stanford so far. 
 
General Comments: Disappointed, but not sad. I mean, I didn't expect to get in, and I'm sure that I'll get in somewhere great. Just kind of mad because after many early decisions have come out and friends have been rejected/denied, I've seen firsthand how much connections and luck come into play. There are complete mongoloids who've gotten into Ivies despite doing no work just because their Dad is a professor at X school, or has donated tons of money -- and that sucks, but you've gotta deal with it. Now I know that this process isn't a true measure of my self-worth. That's liberating in a way, but terrifying too. 
 
Anyways, to prospective applicants: Develop a PASSION. Dance, debate, YouTubing, scientific research -- who cares -- do it with love and care, and do it well. Stanford doesn't just want smart people; they've got more than a healthy pipeline of those applying. In concocting a community, they want somebody who's the BEST at x or y -- not somebody who's a jack of all trades but master of none. If this doesn't sound like you, you'll probably get rejected. But still apply if you're academically qualified; you never know what'll happen. So take that from a rejectee, lol, and good luck.

Reflection: 
 
Strengths: Academics for sure. Even though my SAT score is low, I think the Olympiad experience makes up for it. Participated and won in lots of other science competitions as well. 
Weaknesses: Look at ECs. This definitely hurt me. It wasn't that I wasn't interested or was lazy, just that the rigor and timings of my school really killed alot of opportunities that way. Don't regret it though, have learnt a lot along the way. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: ECs and other outside school stuff. Not a very balanced app. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Not heard from anyone yet. 
 
General Comments: 
 
It's difficult. I don't think I deserved it, especially after only working for US colleges for a year. 
I was hoping that Stanford would look over my lack of ECs for my academics, but they didn't. No worries.

Summer Activities: Working at Papa Murphy's, attending my state's Boys' State program, training for Cross Country season. 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Personal Statement: 9.5/10, I really dug deep for this one and pretty much gave a family life summary and what I've gained from its ups and downs. 
Intellectual Vitality: 8/10, I wrote about engagement in my math courses, and related it to other subject areas. It was a little humorous too, which I think helped. 
Letter to roommate: 10/10, I had trouble planning it out, but I wrote about running all the time and how that would affect my relationship with my roommate. I think it was well organized, and it was easily the most comedic essay I've ever written. 
What matters and why: 6.5/10, I wrote about my strong value of humor, which caused some unintentional irony because the essay itself wasn't that funny.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I truly believe I showed my true colors in my essays, and I think that was a significant factor in my acceptance. Also, although I hate to say it, being Hispanic almost definitely helped as well. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I've only received word from Stanford of my applications' statuses. 
 
General Comments: It really is necessary to reflect on what you're writing within the essays. They value them a lot, and that is where they can see your actual personality as opposed to the robot that is presented by your stats. Good luck to future applicants!

Teacher Rec #2: not gonna rate this one because i honestly have no idea. from my sophomore/senior year english teacher. i'm assuming its pretty good because she wanted to write my rec for me. i took a lot of risks in her class in terms of writing, but they were worth it, and in the process I found myself as a writer, and she knows all of this. 
Counselor Rec: not gonna rate this one either because my counselor is new this year, but I've gotten really close with her in a short amount of time so she knows a lot about me and she basically wrote what i asked her to write lol 
Additional Rec: 11/10 - from my indian music teacher, who's practically my second mom. solid rec, in her words.

General Comments: 
I screamed with joy when I saw that I got deferred, because I seriously thought I was going to get rejected. I'm not gonna mind if they reject me in april, because there are honestly TONS of qualified applicants who deserve a spot at Stanford. I'm just surprised and thankful that i even got this far, cause this was my yolo-est application ever.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
- Common App: Let's just say, the more I read it, the more I cringe... But on the first read many gave me a 8/10. 
- Short q's: 7/10, I thought my answers were a bit cliche... I wasn't feeling anything really pop out to me, but I still think I answered to the best of my ability and was really candid with the answers. 
- Roommate: 7/10, I talked a lot of about food and Disney... haha. I thought it was a little corny at times, but again I was candid. 
- Intellectual vitality: 9/10, I talked about MUN and how although in humanitarian committees (I talked about a committee saving child soldiers) all delegates have a common goal to obvi save child soldiers, we all had different approaches to saving child soldiers. I explained how I thrived from intellectual discourse and the creativity necessary to formulate an effective resolution. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
(Waived my right so I'll just assume) 
Teacher Rec #1: 1000000/10. My Japanese teacher and I are VERY VERY CLOSE. She loves me so much that she asked to write a rec for me during my sophomore year. She is not only my teacher, but also my confidant, and someone who I admire and respect very much. 
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10. My Gov/Econ teacher. She really liked me and we had intellectual conversations of politics. We bonded over shared political ideologies, but no way was I as close to her as I was with my Japanese teacher. I filled out her questions sheet with passion and honesty, and I hope she was thrilled with my answers. 
Counselor Rec: 10/10. Not as close with my counselor because tbh she scares me LOL, but I had a 'mock' interview with her with which she used to write my letter of rec. She praised me throughout the whole interview and really admired my maturation and development as a high school student. I was very candid in the interview as well. 
 
Interview: HHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. Yeah, the interview didn't go too hot. I think I digressed a lot and repeated a lot of the same statements... I also kind of was called out when I said I wanted to go somewhere far like Stanford because I don't fit in in my upper-class suburban neighborhood. My interview pointed out that Stanford was like that... So i just honestly said that I was bored of where I came from. She understood that because as teenagers we tend to thirst for adventure. Honestly, I wanted to go to Stanford because I want to go to CA, and so I brought that up since I used to live in LA, but then she brought up that the Bay Area was very different from LA... So I really couldn't win...

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Honestly, despite my less-than-stellar SAT scores and GPA, my resume is something that I am more than proud of, especially of my volunteering. 
 
Reflection 
 
Strengths: Volunteering, EC's, essays could go both ways 
Weaknesses: SAT, GPA, my comfort with Japanese... 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: There's a rumor that Stanford blacklisted our school. Not even the brightest of the previous classes got accepted. Only one person from our school in 2011 got accepted, and he turned out to be an Olympic-level athlete and a child prodigy.. nbd 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: N/A. Feels good getting my first college decision as a rejection... Looking back, I don't really care about it as much I guess. I really wanted to get in, but I guess the decision was just expected! 
I applied to and still waiting for: 
UCLA (AKA DREAM SCHOOL) 
UCB 
UCI 
UCSD 
University of San Diego

Subjective: 
 
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Soccer and Indoor Track (All 4 years), Math Team (Captain, won states as sophomore, top 10 individual as junior), Sports Analytics Club (Founder), NHS (Treasurer), CT ARML Team (got 46th nationally or something), Probably some other stuff I'm forgetting 
Job/Work Experience: Youth Soccer Ref all 4 years of High School 
Volunteer/Community service: 50+ hours with school community service organization, raised money for diabetes and MS (esp for diabetes as I had my own team for the JDRF walk), peer tutoring with NHS 
 
Summer Activities: Imma be real here, some things but not nearly enough to think I had a shot at getting into Stanford. 
 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common app (9) about diabetes, Madden, and sports statistics, yes they all do connect. Other essays (7-8) I remember thinking they were pretty solid at the time, but considering I only remember 2 of the 4 right now, they couldn't have been that good. Those two were my roommate one about how I am a night person and how that means way more than just staying up late to me and the intellectual vitality one about how I realized during my first semester of high school that, because of the way I learn, I often have to teach myself, simply because I do not learn well from a typical classroom setting. 
 
Teacher Rec #1: English teacher for 2 years (9), liked me a lot because I came in for extra help because English is one of my weaknesses and I improved as a writer because of it 
â¨Teacher Rec #2: Physics teacher for 2 years (6), did well in his class, as well as with the TEAMS competition, which he led; however, I did not have a particularly strong connection with him 
â¨Counselor Rec: I hated her for consistently questioning my courseload as being too hard for me and telling me that USC (a school where the only applicants from my school close to as strong as me got giant scholarships) was a reach for me, but she knew none of this, so I have no idea 
Additional Rec: N/A 
Interview: Pretty good, idk, I think I'm interesting, but my interviewer might not have 
 
Applied for Financial Aid?: yes, no chance at actually getting any 
Intended Major: Engineering 
State (if domestic applicant): CT 
Country (if international applicant): USA 
School Type: public, very white (probably why Stanford hasn't taken anyone from it in 6 years) 
Ethnicity: White

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Legacy (Uncle and Grandfather) 
 
Reflection 
 
Strengths: Weighted GPA (esp considering that it was weighed down a ton by my bad freshman year and French performances), Commitment to sports (esp soccer), Test Scores, Competitive Math 
Weaknesses: Community Service, Summer Activities, Not Well-Rounded (not sure where this goes), 2 of my 3 recs were probably not all too great, not a good writer so essays might have been bad 
Why you think you were rejected: Closest thing to a bum that someone with my grades, etc can be, white and rich, biggest struggle in my life was diabetes which hasn't really been very difficult, not outstanding at any one thing compared to rest of application pool 
Where else you are applying or have already applied: UCLA, USC, UC Berkeley, Yale, UCSD, UC Davis, UPenn, Princeton, UVA 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: N/A 
 
General Comments: I didn't expect to get in, as I was well aware that being pretty good at STEM, but not being extraordinarily involved in research or other extracurricular pursuits, while not having any factors in my background that made my education particularly difficult was just not Stanford material. That being said, I had to apply here, even if I had just a slim chance. Also, before coming here, I was pretty fine with my decision, knowing that I am definitely not one of the most qualified candidates applying and only had a decent chance because of my legacy. However, after looking here, I can't help but think that me being rich and white hurt my chance of admission, which annoys me because that isn't something I can control, even if it did help me somewhat. I wrote more, but it makes me come off as classist, which I don't want to do because my issue is more with just not liking college applications and school. Anyhow, I'll get over this and work on my application for the one place that definitely still favors rich, white kids, Princeton. Also, I would like to thank Stanford for getting me into Tyler, the Creator after my rejection. Immaturity and profanity can be more meaningful than you would ever think.

Interview: 6/10, lukewarm at best; we met in a Starbucks that happened to be located in a Target (very, very noisy) and he didn't seem convinced that high schoolers could do research....

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Siemens, extensive research experience, strong recommendations, some good essays in the mix 
Weaknesses: The one B I got (?), lackluster (comparatively, this is Stanford) SAT, no prestigious awards aside from Siemens, not-so-hot interview, a couple of weak essays, the whole Asian male in STEM deal 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Apparent passion for and achievement in a rather esoteric major 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: first acceptance   
 
Look, I'm not going to tell you to not worry. I worried a lot. I was lightheaded as I opened the portal to check my decision. Somehow, luckily, it worked out for me. Maybe I'll see you on the Farm sometime (am I allowed to say that? I'm not really a student yet....), maybe I won't. But honestly, I'm a firm believer that everyone can succeed wherever they end up. 
 
Good luck to all of you! Stanford University Class of 2020!

Main essay: 8-9. Problem I'd like to solve: clean water for everyone, pretty basic but have a personal experience in the 2014 WV water crisis where our running water was contaminated and we missed school for almost a month 
Vitality: 8, how watching the Bill Nye and Ken Ham debate on evolution shaped my view of the world, how I think for myself now and feel the need to contribute to science and society while I'm still on this earth 
Roommate: 7, I talked about how my roommate needs to respect my sleep schedule, my organization to save me time and space, and love of sports, playing and watching 
What matters: 8-9. Love of sleep. Mentioned health and educational benefits of sleep and how enough sleep makes me feel better in the morning and just how enjoyable it is

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I live in West Virginia and it sucks here, also strong interest in environment with co-founding school's Recycling Club and writing about solving clean water around the world

General Comments: Don't read other people's stats and get discouraged, that's how I felt before and after I submitted my app. Show passion in your extracurriculars and whatever you write about in your essays, I even wrote about sleep! Try to stand out and be personal, don't just write about extracurriculars bc you can bet that's what everyone else is doing. Even if you don't get in, you're definitely not alone and you're still an exceptional student with many other opportunities around this great country!

Wow, can't believe I'm finally making one of these. I've been obsessing of result threads (for better or worst) for the past two years. These were extremely helpful for me, so I hope mine is somewhat helpful to you guys too. If I could give one piece of advice, make sure (especially for Stanford) you essays & recs are amazing. I started the month before it was due and for me it wasn't enough time. I won't lie, I'm a bit disappointed in the result, but I'm not too sad about it. To the rest of us rejects: Be happy that we are at least smart/passionate/worthy enough to have a shot at the best university on Earth.

I don't know what I am doing wrong. This feels terrible. All those weeks with my body hunched over an SAT and ACT Prep book have gone to waste. Even the endless hours studying for AP and IB exams, balancing sports, guitar, and community service, all seem for nothing. I don't know what Stanford expects from anyone anymore. Good luck to all those who got accepted. For all those rejected, do not worry, we still have a long way ahead of us.

Summer Activities: Interlochen Arts Camp Orchestra Program (principle violist, fine arts award, etc), Summer Science Program (NM TECH '15!!), traveling, camping 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 9-10 across the board... Not going to lie, they were probably the most difficult and stressful 5 essays that I've ever had the -pleasure- to write but I'm super happy with how they turned out and believe they capture the (better) part of my personality. As an ordinary applicant with no hooks, I think what got me in to Stanford were my very thoughtful essays. Helpful tip: make it easy for the reader to see who you are, emphasizing themes will help more in painting a picture of who you'll be at their college than random points of note. In my overall application, I emphasized the theme of freedom and my own happy-go-lucky attitude towards life. 
 
Personal essay - I want to stress that you don't HAVE to write about your impressive activities here. That was something I worried a lot about but honestly, all you have to do is show your passion in ANYTHING. I explored my past and family life (as an asian immigrant) and connected it to Thoreau's American Dream in his novel Walden as well as a camping experience over the summer. This seems super complex but the topic was so me that my ideas flowed very freely. The hard part was definitely execution (went through at least 10 drafts)... but I leave that to everyone's individual writing process. 
 
Short essays - since my last essay was super serious, I adopted a very light and carefree tone with my supplements. Again, I wanted to show the adcons how I see the world so I went deep and really reflected on my love of music, my passion for science and humanity, and my appreciation for... small acts of kindness. For the letter to a roommate, I drafted a list of the most important aspects of my life/personality and focused on the little things I love, again tying in my overall theme.

General Comments: To all the younger applicants out there: don't let college be your obsession! The first and most important step to getting into a college/selective-hellhole is pursuing your passions: don't worry about what will look good so much as what you like and dislike. Cultivate who you are as an individual and do what you love. Try to stay aware of your goals and be realistic, but don't let the destination keep you from enjoying the journey. 
 
And to current applicants still looking for a place to be next year: remember to stay true to who you are! Don't think your future depends upon one institution. After all, college is only one path of many to a much longer road beyond... so keep going and I know you'll all be somewhere amazing next year! Good Luck!

Reflection 
 
Strengths: All around interesting person. My story is very interesting. I'm not amazing at one specific thing but I'm good at a lot of things. 
Weaknesses: Because of my jack-of-all trades nature, I didn't really pinpoint much of a single passion. Also my GPA isn't stellar. Plus, I haven't done some amazing project. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Because I'm unique and I'm not a cookie-cutter smart student. I'm engaged in my school community and my passion (albeit multifaceted) shows through my personality. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere yet 
 
General Comments: There are a ton of smart kids out there. I didn't do anything special. I haven't done cancer research or lobbied the UN or whatever, but I'm not your standard student. You can't just be smart. You have to be different.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
Common App: 9, talked about my transition from dance to color guard using the motif of getting a new bed, got really emotionally invested in it, but it was kinda generic 
Intellectual Vitality: 8, used the symbol of a pizza to show my attraction to interdisciplinary studies. I would rate it lower, but my counselor thought the pizza thing was pretty clever 
Roommate: 8, Talked about liking pearl milk tea LOL and how it showed my opposing values for tradition and creativity, showed my sort-of quirky side i think???? 
What Matters: 9, definitely my strongest supplement, talked about approaching leadership in the marching band setting 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 9, he was first my chem teacher in sophomore year and is now teaching my elective course. definitely knows me really well, especially how I tackled struggling in his class by going to him every lunch. his wife was also my english teacher in 7th grade and loved me, which probs helps. 
Teacher Rec #2: 8, my 11th grade english teacher who definitely understood my strengths in understanding literature. unfortunately, i never really knew her personally until recently, when we'd be going on the same service trip together, but she's an EXTREMELY eloquent writer and also a stanford alum 
Counselor Rec: 8, only knows me, but i am her strongest student academically.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Scores, Essays (I think), does being genuine count???? 
Weaknesses: Lack of extracurricular and leadership diversity (ie. invested all my time in one thing), AP/Classes 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Honestly it was a long shot, considering I live in the Bay Area. Stanford is notorious for rejecting even the most qualified students in this area, and I know a bunch of other people much "better" candidates than I am rejected. I am a little sad, but it's nice to just get the weight off of my shoulders. 
 
Also, I found out that I had to turn in my CommonApp early by like a month because I was submitting a portfolio, and this news hit me like a week before my due date. Even though I started my essays early (don't procrastinate, kids), it was still a whirlwind. 
 
General Comments: 
 
To get a little personal here, I do regret applying REA just because it didn't let me apply to another school I definitely would have applied early to if it weren't in the East Coast. I think I was just totally blindsided because I live so near Stanford (like 20 minutes) and have a bunch of merch from when my dad went. So check yo'self before you wreck yo'self.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Common App Essay: 9.9-10/10 I honestly don't know lol. I must have spent forever drafting this essay and wow was it amazing. I discussed how my dad's addiction to substance abuse had driven me to seek validation and appreciation at school. I then discussed how it drove me to advocate for my principal as she was about to be removed because of a change in our school's leadership structure. 
 
Intellectual Vitality: 8/10. I could have spent some more time on it. I talked about how my passion for adventure and exploration shaped me into a curious soul. 
 
Roommate: 10/10. This is hands down one of the best essays ever. I had fun talking about myself and just showing them my heart. My voice is so clear in this. 
 
What Matters: 10/10. Also incredible. I wrote an extended metaphor essay, comparing my life to a buffet. I talked about how I love Stanford's academic freedom because I love all foods. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
AP Calc - 10/10. I waived FERPA, but he let me read it. It brought tears to my eyes it was absolutely amazing. 
Honors Chemistry/Medical Interventions - Unknown. Haven't read it, but I purposely chose this teacher because I struggled in her classes so much and I thought she could speak to my resilience. 
Counselor - 10/10. Haven't read it, but my counselor is the coolest person ever and we're like best friends so it's probably pretty amazing. 
Key Club Advisor - 9/10. Talked about my passion for service: "<My name> always has a smile on his face even at the end of the most disastrous day."

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I honestly believe that my personality shined through on my application and that they saw that.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10; One was hands down the best essay I've ever written. I wrote about why I wanted to be a doctor, including the loss of my brother just months before applying. I truly wrote from the heart for the first time ever probably. My other essay was about growing up poor, sleeping inside of a closet for a year like Harry Potter, but not because my family hated me, my "bed" (it was legit made out of ply-wood by my dad) just didn't fit anywhere else in our tiny trailer. I did actually include that bit about Harry Potter to open and close off the essay, I thought it was fun.

General Comments: I honestly think that what set me apart were my essays. I literally cried while writing one of them, and normally I am an emotionless robot who tries to blend in by pretending to comprehend human feelings. No, but seriously that's what I think did it for me, apart from meeting the basic academic stats. Now I must decide between Harvard and Stanford, my top 2. We'll see where I go.

Volunteer/Community service: Volunteered as clerical assistant at a doctor's office, tutor/mentor for an organization at a middle school, food pantry, Special Olympics swim coach, online work for two debate charities 
Summer Activities: swimming and debate camp for summer before freshman and sophomore year, coding camp (really all I learned was that coding is not for me), debate camp and Stanford HEAT Institute summer before junior, research internship, work for debate charities, and Special Olympics coaching summer before senior. For the app I mentioned that I also learned how to drive summer before senior year, probably did not affect admission 
 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
Common app: 9/10 wrote about research which felt pretty generic but I put it in a creative format and made it more about how the project forced me to grow up than the content of the project itself 
Room mate: 9/10 finished this hours before the deadline, basically filled it with facts about myself based on an ordinary day with me. Had a clever-ish hook about social media. I would've originally scored this lower but my admissions counselor wrote in her letter to me that she liked it so I guess it was better than I thought. 
Intellectual vitality: 10/10 one of the best essays I've ever written, was about confronting privilege and why I (mostly) quit debate. felt sort of ballsy because it was about quitting a major extracurricular but I thought it turned out well 
What matters to you: 7/10 despite many warnings to explicitly not do this, I wrote about religion (I'm Buddhist). used Buddhism to explain some facets of my character. Didn't love it but it was okay. 
Short answers: 9/10 Probably didn't affect admission but I had a lot of fun with these. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10, read it for a later scholarship, was so good it made me cry. Teachers rock. 
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10, equally as good as first in terms of content but slightly less eloquent. 
Counselor Rec: 10/10 presumably, have been close with my counselor for years, and I don't think the counselor rec usually consists of much beyond "she was a good student and she didn't commit any felonies" 
Additional Rec: 10/10, doctor at the doctor's office I volunteered at, she liked me a lot and her writing was excellent

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Essays, teacher recs, community service, unsure whether to say test scores/grades bc I feel like many who get rejected have better scores/grades than I did 
Weaknesses: Lack of major scientific awards to show for the amount of research I did, less extracurriculars than many/not well rounded in extracurriculars 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: lots of luck. I felt like essays were my strongest point, but the more I think about it I suspect my quasi-legacy through my sister and uncle probably helped. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to UT but rejected from UT honors  , waiting to hear from Harvard. 
 
General Comments: For someone with my socioeconomic position I didn't feel like I achieved way more than I was expected to, and I'm still in shock at my acceptance. When I was doing applications and lurking on all the 2020 applicant threads I felt sure that my single-minded extracurriculars and lack of any major scientific award would screw me over, but it didn't. Assuming I wasn't solely a legacy admit, what I learned from this is that it's okay to only pursue activities that you really care about rather than do a slew of ECs that mean nothing to you. I probably could've stacked my ECs more but there's no way I would've been as successful in debate and research if I did; heck I straight up quit piano and swim once I got more into debate because I wanted to spend all my time in debate and nowhere else. For those of you who really hate a lot of the ECs you're doing and want to quit and focus on one thing, I encourage you to do so if that's truly what you're most passionate about. Good luck to those of you waiting to hear from RD!

Reflection 
 
Strengths: strong grades and test scores, unique essays 
Weaknesses: no truly impressive extracurriculars 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Early Action helps. My essays weaved my modestly strong extracurricular narrative into one solid story. Tbh I think God smiled upon me that day. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: 
Accepted: WUSTL, Notre Dame (likely, Mendoza), Cornell Engineering, Brown, safeties 
Waitlisted: Case Western Reserve (LOL to the thousandth degree!), Harvard, Penn 
Rejected: Princeton 
 
General Comments: Thank you Stanford! You made the rest of senior year, with IB Internal Assessments and whatnot, especially worth it! To everyone who was accepted, kudos! To everyone deferred/waitlisted, never give up, but only send in new material if it is truly significant. To everyone still stinging from a rejection, you will be accepted somewhere (hopefully many places) that are equally strong. I wish you "a bit of luck!"

Posting for my son. I did the lurking (and worrying) here when he was applying for the Class of 2020! 
 
Objective: 
SAT I : 2260 (one sitting) 
ACT (breakdown): Did not take 
SAT II: Math II (780), 
Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): school does not use the 4.0 scale 
Weighted GPA: School does not weight grades 
Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): school does not report rank but was top 2.5% of class 
AP (place score in parenthesis): School does not offer, most students take them once they are admitted to college and know which ones their school accepts. Took two but after admission. 
IB (place score in parenthesis): none 
Senior Year Course Load: was very challenging 
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): 3 prestigious awards given within the school, National Language awards 
 
Subjective: 
 
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): many leadership positions, involved in a number of EC clubs throughout high school along with two sports 
Job/Work Experience: summer work only 
Volunteer/Community service: Peer tutoring, teaching a sport to underprivileged kids 
Summer Activities: worked as a teacher's aide and camp counselor every summer, prepped for SAT's 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): all extremely strong 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): also extremely strong 
 
Counselor Rec: has been a college counselor for 2 decades, excellent letter 
Additional Rec: additional letter of support from current Stanford professor 
Interview: not offered

State (if domestic applicant): CA 
Country (if international applicant): 
School Type: well-known rigorous college prep 
Ethnicity: Caucasian 
Gender: male 
Income Bracket: above FA eligible 
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): legacy 
 
Reflection 
 
Strengths: excellent essays- had a special area of interest that he weaved through many of his essays 
Weaknesses: no AP's and only one SAT II but it didn't seem to matter 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: somewhat special area of interest, essays, near top of class, challenging high school courses, legacy, California resident 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: did not complete applications to other private schools since Stanford was first choice 
Accepted: at all UC's applied to 
Waitlisted: none 
Rejected: none 
 
General Comments: He had the whole package but even with that- it's a long shot! We were prepared to be disappointed but thrilled when he was accepted. He knows that he would have gotten in somewhere else great if it hadn't been Stanford. Outside of the fact that you need strong grades, test scores, letters of rec etc... one of things that I think they take a very hard look at are the essays. He started in August once the Common App was out before he was busy with school- he had the rough drafts done by the time school started, had 2 different (very experienced) college counselors, along with another teacher, read his essays and he honed them over Sept and Oct. He submitted his app a few days before the deadline. Give yourself plenty of time, proof read everything- essays as well as other Common App sections and then hope for the best. It's crazy stressful but it really does all work out! Best of Luck!

Counselor Rec: She got it together at the last second despite that I asked her about a month in advance.  No idea.

Summer Activities: CTY, college orchestra program, Yale Ivy Scholars Program (now Young Global Scholars - I highly recommend this program), VA Governor's Latin Academy, undergraduate research program on Big Data 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): looking back, they were oh so strange. 
Common App (9): prompt #5, an intense and convoluted story about my experience at Yale's Ivy Scholars Program and how I learned to "steer my own ship along the stream of time" (my friends/parents told me there was no way I'd get into most schools by writing about YALE of all things :'D). 
Intellectual Vitality (10): about playing Legend of Zelda games and connecting it to logic puzzles as well as the mathematics regarding nonlinearity of plot and dungeon structure.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: test scores, grades and classes, research/math competitions, maybe...essays since I had so much fun with them 
Weaknesses: ECs, definitely. Even though I've done them consistently, they just feel weak compared to people who do a lot more in the community. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: research/math competitions are the main things that make me stand out. The rest is luck! 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: accepted to Princeton (early), UVA (early), and MIT; no rejections so far 
 
General Comments: Congratulations to everyone who was accepted! For everyone else, I'm looking at the schools that you did get into...and wow. Let's face it, decisions are so random sometimes. But I am confident that everyone is going to get far in life

Volunteer/Community service: Program through school where we educate disenfranchised youth about nutrition and exercise 
Summer Activities: touring, playing at Lollapalooza, being studious in summer classes, tutoring people, preseason for Cross Country. 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): TERRIBLE. My essays were terrible. I'm convinced they didn't read them. For instance--I swear this is true--I answered the question about my favorite websites with "stanford.edu." Not making this up. (I guess I planned to change it later and just forgot.) The one thing is, since I clearly forgot to edit, my "true self" really shined through. 
Intellectual vitality essay: 5/10, about the Fermat Equation. 
Roommate essay: 8/10, about how I promise to use headphones when playing my Korg at 1:34 AM and plan to rope her into 5-mile runs. 
What matters essay: Music, actually a pretty good essay about the Cleveland music community and how even though none of them "made it," their continued dedication to music inspires me. 9/10. 
Common app: great (because I actually edited it). 
Recommendations: I feel like I keep thinking they were better as I get into better and better schools. On my old posts I ranked them 8/10, haha. 
Teacher Rec #1: Math teacher. He's awesome. 10/10. 
Teacher Rec #2: History teacher, I've taken 5 courses with him and he's my all-time fave. 10/10. 
Counselor Rec: No idea, but I assume it was good. 
Additional Rec: Music theory teacher. She's like family. 10/10. 
Interview: Didn't have one. I have a local Stanford alum, and I tutor his kids, but he never sent in a letter or anything, and I never got an interview invite. 
Art Supplement: Composition. It was pretty good (not good enough to get me into Juilliard, but hey, Gershwin didn't get into Juilliard, so who cares?)

Reflection 
 
Strengths: MY VOICE, because I did not edit or censor (I guess. I forgot to.) My love for Cher, trip to Lollapalooza, and passion for stanford.edu all made their way onto the page. 
Weaknesses: SAT II scores. But we are all imperfect. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Totally random. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted Duke, Williams, Caltech, UChicago, Harvey Mudd, UCLA, Berkeley, OSU, Mich, Amherst, Cornell, Case. Waitlisted MIT, deferred Princeton. Rejected Juilliard but otherwise nowhere yet (but buckle down, kids, Ivy Day is right around the corner.) 
 
General Comments: what. WHAT. I submitted an art supplement, so I realized on November 30 that instead of just that supplement, my ENTIRE APPLICATION was due on December 1. Obviously I scrambled and didn't "edit everything down" to the monotonous words of a high school drone. Maybe that's what they liked.

Volunteer/Community service: I work a lot with GSA Network Southern California. I was a Youth Trainer for their #WerkItTour in three cities where I lead with one other trainer a 9-hour youth summit. I volunteer at my local LGBTQ Center, The Outreach Center. I have helped with the Veterans Day parade in my hometown. 
Summer Activities: I took the two classes I was allowed to take every summer after tenth grade at my community college in order to be able to gain enough credits to graduate with a degree. I also frequented the OutProject, which is the local LGBTQ youth group. 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
Common App: I would say is a 9/10 since it was laboriously edited and I really spoke from the heart. I feel like the essay spoke to itself and it came together the way I wanted it to. Talked about my life through literature and my journey in realizing my passions 
Intellectual Vitality:  10/10 I talked about the Three Systems of Oppression (Patriarchy, White Supremacy, and Capitalism) and how that opened my mind up. I talked about how I learned so much about myself and other people. I talked about the intellectual and emotional journey I went through after I discovered this. This is what I was trained to talk about and I feel a lot towards this subject. 
Roommate Essay: 9/10 I LOVED my letter to my future roommate. I really expressed my personality in this one and I was genuine about everything I said. It was well-written and empathetic, I think. I'm giving it a 9 because the last line sounds a little contrived to me now. 
What Matters Essay: 10/10 This is the best thing I wrote for the College Application process. I wrote about how Stories are what matters most to me, how they are essential to humanity, how they can reach across societal boundaries, how they are necessary for living etc. I actually got emotional writing this one at the time and felt the same surge of emotion reading it, so I definitely meant every word to my core. 
 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 8/10 My US History teacher who really understands my moral codes, my thoughts on history, my thoughts on social issues etc. He has a very good picture of me. I rated it an 8 only because I feel like it wasn't as heartfelt? as I feel a good rec should be. He definitely meant it, though. 
Teacher Rec #2: 10/10 My Anatomy and Physiology AND Psychology teacher who knows me so well and is so invested in my happiness and always talks about how glad she is she knows me. The teacher I am closest to in high school. I know she gave me an amazing rec, I can feel it. 
Counselor Rec: No idea, I don't talk to my counselor very often, but I feel like she probably wrote a 7/10 at the least. 
Additional Rec: None, although I should have asked my GSA Network mentor to write one haha. 
Interview: No interview.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: DEFINITELY my essays; I was so so so happy with them, I wouldn't change a word. My recs were definitely strong as well. I think my dedication to the LGBTQ community showed in my application. Also my essays tied in really really well with my major and career goals. 
Weaknesses: Definitely my SAT score and I am a late bloomer when it comes to Extracurriculars. I didn't find my niche until junior year. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: ESSAYS AND RECS. I didn't censor myself at all and really poured myself into my application. I actually mentioned FANFICTION of all things FIVE TIMES in my writings and revealed that I consume it at a rate of 100K a day. NO joke. I was super honest about myself and who I was and where I was at this point of my life as a person. I did all of this in my essays. Also, I am graduating from high school with my AA degree in Arts and Humanities (63 college credits), and being IGETC-certified. I busted my butt to catch up and do this in time to graduate. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was accepted to UCLA, UCSB, UC Berkeley, UCSC, Williams College, Swarthmore College, CSU Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, CSU Northridge, Boston University, Vassar College, Carleton College. I was waitlisted for Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University. I was rejected by University of Chicago and Northwestern University. I am still waiting on Yale, Haverford College, USC, and UPenn. 
 
General Comments: SO SO SO EXCITED TO HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED!!!! I AM SO PUMPED. I am so grateful for how hard I worked on those essays I am positive that is what ultimately got me accepted :DD

Job/Work Experience: N/A 
Volunteer/Community service: Volunteered at local Red Cross chapter since 8th Grade, also through on campus clubs 
Summer Activities: Went to several camps. Had this awesome Economics camp my senior year which I wrote about in my essays. 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App Essay (7/10): It was about me finding myself through failure. I think it was solid but there was nothing special about it. What Matters (8/10): Wrote about my grandpa, his illness, and his role in my life. Topic was kind of cliche I guess but I thought I had an interesting take on it. Intellectual Vitality (9/10): It was really solid. Roommate Letter (8/10): I think I took a kind of bold spin on mine instead of going for the usual "this is me" spin. It was a bit philosophical but I figured it was bold (and I needed bold). Short Answers (9/10): I think my answers were really well thought out and unique. 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 10. I've known my English teacher since before 9th grade when I first made newspaper in middle school. I've had him for newspaper three years and both AP English Language and Literature, and he's also my club adviser. He's basically like my second father; we've had a lot of one-on-one talks after school and lunch starting my sophomore year; he was the one that encouraged me to apply to reach schools like Stanford actually when I figured I'd be content with Cal or USC. He said my writing was among the best he's seen in his career and he told me to email him my essays during the summer and gave me a lot of feedback. I am so, so glad to have a mentor like him. 
Teacher Rec #2: 8. I struggled a lot in Honors Precalculus/Calculus A, and it was actually one of the only two B's I received in all of high school prior to senior year. But my Precalc teacher knows how came in at lunch and would ask for help a lot, and though I struggled early on junior year, I improved and got an A second semester. 
Counselor Rec: 6. I go to a large public school with 3500+ students, and I didn't even get my normal counselor lol. They assigned some temp counselor that probably wrote a generic form letter for all of my privates. 
Additional Rec: N/A 
Interview: N/A

Applied for Financial Aid?: Yes 
Intended Major: Economics 
State (if domestic applicant): CA 
Country (if international applicant): N/A 
School Type: Large Public (3500+ Students) 
Ethnicity: Asian 
Gender: M 
Income Bracket: Don't want to be too specific. Enough to qualify for financial aid at Stanford but not enough for federal grants. 
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Not really. 
 
Reflection 
 
Strengths: I had great stats, especially for science and mathematics. Looking back at it, I should have applied myself more in those subjects (although I'm dying in physics right now) and tried out for those academic teams. I also think my essay writing was really solid, although Stanford wasn't my best app. 
Weaknesses: Extracurriculars come to mind. Considering my background, I don't have anything that stands out. I definitely had the numbers to get into a place like Stanford but I know that there was more I could have done. I don't really regret not doing more because I have a lot of great memories from what I did instead, but at the same time, I understand there was a consequence for the choices I made. 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I just failed to stand out from the application pool. I believe that I was qualified, but I think the same can be said for almost everyone else that applied to Stanford. Looking at this thread, everyone here is so phenomenal and there just isn't enough space for every single one of us. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: 
Accepted - Cal, UCLA, UCSD, UC Irvine, Fordham, Washington 
Waitlisted - Caltech 
Deferred - Princeton SCEA 
Rejected - Stanford, MIT, Northwestern, USC 
 
Most likely going to Cal but waiting on some Ivies. Going out with a bang. 
 
General Comments: It would have been nice to have, but I always knew that it was a long shot. I'm glad that I'm in a situation where I still have some really great options (Cal and UCLA) to go to next year, and that I still have hope considering the process is not yet done for me. Looking back on it, I'm glad that I applied to Stanford, even though I didn't get in. I learned a lot about myself from writing the essays and going through the next experience. To those of you reading this next year, if there's one thing you get out of this it's this: don't be afraid to try. I know it's said you miss all the shots you don't take, and I believe that's true. I'll never have the benefit of the doubt on this decision, and I know this rejection doesn't take anything away from my accomplishments. I didn't quite achieve my dreams, but I'm still proud of what I accomplished. I'm going to be a Bear next year most likely, and I'm going to enjoy watching The Game. Good luck to all of you on the waitlist and those of you applying next year!

General Comments: Best of luck to future applicants! To anyone hearing back now, good luck in your future endeavorsâwhether or not you got into Stanford or any other school, I'm sure great things are in store. Can't wait to be done with high school!

Qualified to NSDA in public forum, got second in a city-wide award for best international relations student, and won a writing award since applying, but didn't send in because I didn't really want to. 
 
Subjective: 
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parentheses): Global Studies Club (President), Debate (Leader, there is no president), 9 years piano with a very prominent teacher, Newspaper (Executive editorâintroduced two new publications and created a whole new system to oversee it), Academic WorldQuest, Model UN (lots of awards including at the MUN UChicago), huffpost teen, trivia stuff, etc, etc,

Volunteer/Community Service: About 200 hours over four years or so. 
Summer Activities: Arabic 110 at the University of Kansas, California Scholastic Press Association Summer Workshop 
Essays: Common app was very good, not to sound arrogant. Talked about doing things just because I wanted to, not for competitions or anything, using piano as an example. 
Stanford Supplement: It was decent. Threw it together quickly, but I liked the message that came through and felt like it gave at least a decent image of me as a person. 
Teacher Recommendations: Journalism teacher and history/government teacher. Both had me for three years and moderated the activities in which I participate, should have been great. I'll never know. 
Counselor Rec: He had me in class, and I won the award for it, and it's the best class I've ever taken, so should have been very good and personal cause we really got along.

Reflection 
Strengths: Test scores, ECs focus on journalism and international affairs, 
Weaknesses: GPA, GPA, GPA. White male perhaps. 
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: A lot of interest. I've been there a bunch, know a lot about it, etc. Who knows, not my place to say. 
Where else you are applying or have already applied: Accepted to University of Missouri, University of Chicago. Unconditional offer to read History and Politics at Magdalen College, Oxford University. Rejected: Stanford. Waiting on: Yale and Harvard 
General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: To be 100% honest, this makes my life much easier. This was the one school that would make me doubt going to Oxford â because Yale, Harvard, and UChicago are all, to varying degrees, based on Oxford and I like the original versionâand getting rejected just means I can be totally sure in my choice. Also, now I get to say I attended the President and Fellows of the College of St. Mary Magdalen at the University of Oxford, wh. If any future applicants have any questions about applying to Oxford, check ****.co.uk for the "So, you're an American thinking about applying to Oxford thread." Life saver.

Volunteer/Community service: Numerous. See "Extracurriculars" 
Summer Activities: Tutoring 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): My short questions all maxed out the word limits. There were actually some errors, but it was all very honest, so I'd give them a solid 9. A nice mix of sophisticated and quirky. For example, my favorite artists were Bosch, Duchamp, Klimt, Van Gogh, Mike Borja (my uncle lol), Frida Kahlo, Childish Gambino, and Bjork. I said that apathy was the most significant challenge today, and I talked about Netflix and wisdom teeth surgery when answering the question about my summer. I would also give my short essays a solid 9, because they were personal and different from what I think a lot of other people might have said. I talked about my success with spelling bees as a kid and how that led to an infatuation with linguistics for the intellectual vitality one. For the letter to my roommate, I wrote about how I like to build forts and work late in to the night, as well as how much I love to play video games. My final essay was about addressing injustice. Again, I truly felt that all of these were incredibly strong. As you could tell from my previous stats, writing and english are my strong suits. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: 10. My APUSH, Psych, and Gov teacher who has worked with me in the classroom and in extracurriculars. It was like 5 pages long and beautifully written. Best recommendation that I could ask for, very comprehensive. 
Teacher Rec #2: 9. From my English teacher (both for pre-AP as a freshman and AP as a senior) who also happened to be my AP Art History Teacher. Much more compact than my other one, but focused more on who I was as a student of the humanities, which really helped for my applied focuses of English, Education, or Linguistics. 
Counselor Rec: 8. I honestly never got to read this one, but she was very fond of me and was always impressed with my accomplishments and invested in my success. I'm guessing that it was pretty good. 
Additional Rec: I submitted a peer recommendation late, so I'm not sure if it was actually considered. But it was pretty good. It was from an upperclassman who had graduated last year. I had replaced him as president in many of our extracurriculars, and he was a dear friend who was able to speak candidly about my character and my leadership abilities.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: The written parts of Stanford's app were very intuitive for me, so all of those felt very strong. Extracurriculars, yearly course load, grades. Consistency of voice/character throughout all of my responses 
Weaknesses: Math scores. 
Why you think you were accepted: Like I said, their application was incredibly intuitive for me, which leads me to believe that I am a good fit for this school. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: UOP (Pacific Humanities Scholars Program), UC Berkeley, UC Davis (Regents and Honors), UCLA, Johns Hopkins. I haven't been waitlisted or rejected yet. Just waiting on Harvard and UPenn! 
 
General Comments: On a side note, I attended the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes for Expository Writing this last summer, so it was beneficial for me to get a feel for the campus culture. I feel very lucky that Stanford's unconventional application worked well for me, but I would advise anyone looking to apply in the future to be very honest about their answers. I saw on Stanford's website that this year was the biggest applicant pool in the history of the school, so I can only imagine how competitive it was! Congratulations to all who were accepted, and best of luck to any future applicants. I hope this helps!

Essays (rating 1-10, details):: good Common App essay (9/10), unique short-answer questions. I thought my roommate essay was unoriginal (I wrote it last-minute), but the other two seemed pretty good. 
Teacher Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):: 10, 6 or 7 (I'm not as close to this teacher)

Reflection 
Strengths: high stats, leadership, good essays and recs, difficult courseload. 
Weaknesses: I still feel like my ECs and awards were slightly weak. (It was harder to participate in extracurriculars since Iâm homeschooled.) 
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think I had a unique combination of interests (comp sci + economics and other humanities) that may have appealed to Stanford (after all, this is the school with the CS+X program). I also think that being homeschooled may have helped me stand out. But I'm totally shocked and ecstatic! 
Where else you are applying or have already applied: likely letter + Science Research Fellows from Columbia; accepted to Rice, University of Michigan, Alabama (with full-tuition+), Maryland (with 48k scholarship), George Mason (with 40k scholarship), Rochester (with 19k scholarship); deferred from Princeton; waitlisted from WashU and UChicago.

Job/Work Experience: 
Volunteer/Community service: Volunteer at Science Museum and volunteer teaching young dancers (both weekly) 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
Intellectual Vitality (8.5): talked about how my experience with the amazing academic community at YSP inspired me to apply to Stanford 
Roommate (8): wrote about my love of snacks and revealed a few of my interests; funny and light 
What Matters (10): this essay meant a lot to me and I think it showed. I wrote about how I integrate my past and my future through collections of objects in a 'memory box,' and it pretty much captured what drives me as a person. 
Common App (9): put a lot of work into it. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
Teacher Rec #1: 7.5/10. Written by both the TA and the professor of my pre-calc II class at the university; I got the highest score on the final exam out of a class of a few hundred college kids, so I hoped the letter would help make up for my crap SAT math score. Probably pretty generic though. 
Teacher Rec #2: 7.5/10. Written by my anthropology professor whom I loved, don't know how well he knew me though 
Counselor Rec: 8/10. She likes me. Mostly. 
Additional Rec: none, but I did submit an ok arts supplement for dance. 
Interview: 8/10. We had a very nice conversation and he told me I would be a good fit for Stanford.

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Essays. I'm pretty sure that's what got me in. A lot of self-reflection and emotion went into them, and I was genuine and personal in everything I presented. I wrote the essays thinking more about the challenge of capturing myself in a few hundred words on paper rather than thinking about what Stanford would like.

Reflection 
I was definitely not expecting much from Stanford. I knew there were much more qualified students out there who would probably overshadow me and that's okay! I took the shot and I don't regret it at all! Actually, If I didn't put my heart and soul into my Stanford essays, I probably wouldn't have been so inspired to write such amazing essays that got me into some of the best universities in the nation! I'm pretty happy with how everything has turned out and I'm definitely grateful for all the opportunities - so not feeling bummed or heartbroken. Good luck to all future applicants and Congratulations to those who were accepted!

Strengths: Scores, URM, heavy involvement in EC

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: California has the biggest and most competitive academic decathlon program in the nation. My ECs, based around Decathlon, pale in comparison to what Stanford has probably seen. Also, I wasn't able to send in an update when I placed first in the state after my regionals competition, so I felt like my awards were not as solid as I could have made them. Stanford also has a huge applicant pool. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted: Penn (likely), Cornell (likely), NYU (full tuition), Northeastern (honors), ASU. Waiting on: Yale, Columbia (deferred), and Harvard 
General Comments: I expected it! I mean, you have to expect a rejection from every school like this. So I'm not upset at all, and I already have gotten fantastic offers. Congratulations to all of those who were accepted!! You guys are truly admirable. And to those rejected, you just got rejected from the most selective school in the country. It isn't the end of the world!

  I suck at writing, especially about myself. I also donât have amazing SAT and ACT scores. And IB and AP wasnât offered at my school. 
  My SAT/ACT werenât up to par and I didnât proofread my essays (oops). 
  I have a scholarship (almost full ride) to a college in my hometown and at Houston Baptist University. Waiting on Columbia and USC. I also was selected as a finalist for the Gates Millennium Scholarship (but I didnât know that at the time of the application) and am waiting for that decision. 
 
 
-Iâm shocked that I was even waitlisted tbh. (like Iâm not even sad â just happy that they think I was good enough to be considered. lol) 
-Congrats to all who made it! You have worked very hard and itâs about time schools are starting to see that. 
-And donât be too down if you didnât. Stanford is super picky and it does not mean you arenât a wonderful candidate. Good luck for any other colleges and scholarships you are applying for!

Essays (rating 1-10, details): Dang, I worked my ass off on these essays. Disappointed they didn't stand out enough. 
- Roommate: Had a lot of fun with this one. I talked about Once Upon a Time (my fav show--it's so good!! Go watch it!), and then wrote "confessions" of quirky things about me (10/10) 
- Vitality: I compared computer science with cooking turkey, one of my fav essays. I reused this one on multiple apps (10/10) 
- What matters: Family. I know, it's cliche but it's the truth. I wrote an anecdote of eating dim-sum with my parents when I was a kid, and there was a special moment when my dad told me he expected me to treat him and my mom to dim-sum when I become an adult. Idk, but it's an important memory for me. (9/10) 
- Extracurricular was about Computer Club and my excitement/pride for it (8/10)

Reflection 
 
Strengths: Essays, first gen, high SAT score for a low income student, pretty decent extra currics, showing a lot of interest in one thing, unique story (lived out of the house and without dad since four years ago) 
Weaknesses: my race, physics SAT subject score, AP scores 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: It's extremely competitive, of course Stanford attracts all the best of the best, and there are a lot of factors you can't control in this process. I think for Stanford they don't pick you whether you're "good enough" but they pick you based on "is there already another student here with the same identity?" 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Lots of rejections haha. Accepted: University of Washington, USC (Presidential scholarship), Vassar, University of Virginia. Waitlisted: Harvey Mudd. Rejected: Pomona, Berkeley, MIT. Waiting on Ivies (not going to get into any so likely USC if financial situation plays out well) 
 
General Comments: 
It's a bummer since Stanford was my dream school but really there's no point sulking about something you can't change. And hey the competition is real. Congrats to those admitted, WOOT WOOT, PARTY IN DA HOUSE! 
 
I'm going to work hard to be successful and this setback won't matter anymore

Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Computer Science Club (VP), DECA (VP), Student Government (Treasurer), Violin, Taekwondo (Black Belt), NHS, Software developer for various companies, made some programs on my own as well. Created a small tech company (& sold part of it) < That's probably what got me on the waitlist instead of rejected. 
Job/Work Experience: Worked at a local university doing some technical/programming work. 
Volunteer/Community service: Not much, volunteered at Teen Court 
Summer Activities: Just various free programs that I applied for. 
 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 9/10. I don't want to go into too much detail on them. I'm not the best writer, but I spent a lot of time on them. Some were just about my extracurriculars, but most were about who I am as a person. The prompts really allow you to open up, and I thoroughly enjoyed writing these essays. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Overall excellent 
Teacher Rec #1: Math Teacher for two years, probably a 9/10 
Teacher Rec #2: English Teacher, excellent writer, probably a 9/10

Strengths: Essays, Extracurriculars, Recommendations 
Weaknesses: SAT, SAT Subject Tests, Course Rigor 
Why you think you were waitlisted: I think I had great extracurriculars, but I didn't really take challenging classes, and because of that I didn't take any SAT Subject Tests either. Also I mean it's Stanford so... 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted: Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, and Georgia Tech. Rejected: UC Berkeley. 
 
General Comments: I'm actually happy I even got on the waitlist. Years ago, I never thought I'd even be applying to a school like Stanford. There are so many people who are much academically stronger than I am who got rejected. Even though they rarely take anyone off the waitlist, I'm just happy I made it this far, and that they actually cared about my application. Congrats to all those who got in. I'm sure we'll all do well no matter where we go. 
 
To future applicants: Don't stress so much over every test and taking every AP class. Yes, they'll help you get into college and if you enjoy them, that's great, but if you spend time doing things that make you smile, things that you really care about, you'll enjoy high school so much more. In my opinion (although I'm sure not everyone agrees with me), that is so much more important than an acceptance letter. A name like Stanford will definitely help you, but it doesn't mean you can't find your own success elsewhere.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): I thought they were good obviously, but who knows how the admissions felt about it. I wrote about my position as a Sexual Assault Victim Advocate and my dedication towards ending the acceptance of sexual violence in our culture in the Common App essay. In the Additional Info, I wrote about being from Hawai'i and my cultural sense of 'ohana.

Strengths: I think my strengths are that I am a URM, and I am very passionate about advocacy work that not many high school kids are involved in. 
Weaknesses: I indicated that I was interested in a science major, and I don't have the original research/impressive scientific course-load that many have (aside from AP Environmental, AP Chem, AP Physics 1, and Biochem/Biophysics at Yale Summer Session). 
General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: Don't do something simply because people say "colleges like to see it". Find something you are passionate about, and commit yourself to it. Chances are, you will end up doing some pretty awesome things because your passion will naturally lead you to pursue opportunities. Plus, you will be happy and enthusiastic as well.

This is my 2 cents... don't try to force what you think Stanford wants (quirky) just write about what you really love! I even wrote about Porsche winning LeMans. Although it's cliche I can't help but stress that you need to be yourself. And, if the adcons like who you are, than awesome! If they don't, than you might not be the perfect fit that they are looking for. Long 2 cents, but in summary: don't force a perfect application, no one's perfect! GOOD LUCK class of 2020!! 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Teacher Rec #1: (10) I always went in after class to talk to this said teacher regarding project ideas I had. We got pretty close, to where we could joke around and it was obvious in class he liked me. 
Teacher Rec #2: (8) I think that this said teacher wrote me a good rec. But, I have no real way to tell. We really weren't that close. 
Counselor Rec: (10) I've gotten really close to my councilor over the years, so I have good reason to believe that this Rec was really good. 
Additional Rec: I sent in two additional rec letters by snail mail. I don't think that Stanford really wants additional info, but I truly believed the two letters gave the adcon a deeper understanding of me.

Reflection: I would never had though I would get into Stanford!! But, I am so excited to have. For the class of 2020 here are some tips that I felt helped me through the application process: Read your essays over and over. Don't be afraid if you think an essay is bad to completely throw it out and start anew (I did this a couple of times). Please don't write about anything cliche- you can find cliche topics easily with Google (AVOID THESE).

General Comments: Don't fret over college admissions, guys. Give your applications everything you have and just hope for the best.

BLOWN AWAY. WHAT THE HELL. Stanford was the one school that I thought I had absolutely NO CHANCE at. I had a small hope for Harvard or Yale but Stanford was a no-no as far as I was concerned. The chips have fallen in a way I totally did not expect.

Essays: 
Common App: About how I challenged people's beliefs about me because as a petite, nerdy girl, I can do lots of push-ups. It was kind of funny, and everyone who read it liked it. I spent a long time on it. 9/10 
Intellectual Vitality Essay: About how I realized that inspiration doesn't need to come from intellectual sources, that even something as simple as a balance beam can inspire me.  8/10 
Letter to Roommate:  Rewrote and rewrote this one.  I apologized for a conversation that I said we were going to have in which I was fascinated with a stupidly obscure topic and I neglected my duties as a roommate.  It sounds bad, but I thought it was very funny, and multiple other people read it and they all liked it. 9/10 
What matters to you and why?: Probably my best essay of this admissions season.  Talked about how being adventurous was important to me, and how going to someplace faraway like Stanford was the adventure that I craved.  It included my favorite line of all my college essays: "I love the sound of planes flying overhead.  It reminds me that we are not stuck anywhere in this world."  DANG IT STANFORD HOW DID YOU NOT SEE MY GENIUS    10/10 
Teacher Recommendation #1: Not sure. I picked this teacher because he saw me help out other students in his class, but it's impossible for me to say if he wrote a lot about that in his rec. 
Teacher Recommendation #2: I think this one was good. This teacher and I were kind of on the same wavelength, and I gave him a ton of supplemental information to pull from.

General Comments: 
 
Not going to lie, this one really upset me.  Can't say I didn't see it coming, but Stanford's been the dream for like two years now.  I threw my all into this app, I even delayed sending for REA to make sure it was perfect, and I came up short.  I don't think there was anything more I could have done.  We'll see, maybe I'll send out a transfer app for kicks, but I'll probably try again for grad school.  You can't get rid of me that easily, Stanford.

Summer Activities: 8-week course @ UC Berkeley, biology research @ my high school, volunteering/tutoring 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): common app 8 (first prompt, really showed my love/appreciation for opportunities and awareness of privilege); supplements 6-8 maybe? (most of my essays were written about my love for music and desire to delve deeper into everything I learn, so consistent themes throughout, definitely) 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 
Teacher Rec #1: I read it-- 8/10? short but sweet, really focused on my personality and awareness of the world around me 
Teacher Rec #2: Probably really good-- biology teacher freshman & juniors years; I started bio olympiad with her as moderator, and she also really saw my development as a person over the last 4 years 
Counselor Rec: Probably pretty good-- I've talked to her a ton, and she knows how focused I am/was on the college process haha

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Roommate essay maybe? Consistent themes in my essays? Work ethic? To be honest I really have no idea 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: 
Accepted: Cornell (CAS), Berkeley (Engineering), UCLA (Engineering, Regents), UCSD (Bioengineering), UC Davis (ChemE) 
Waitlisted: Columbia (Engineering), UPenn (Eng), JHU (Biomed) 
Rejected: Princeton, MIT 
General Comments: Seriously still in so much shock/awe that I got in-- definitely hasn't fully sunk in yet, and probably won't until move-in day in September. On the admit packet, there was a quote about learning things for the sake of learning them, not because it would be on the test; I think my high school experience was basically that, and it really reflected in a lot of my essays, so maybe that's why they liked me? What scares me though is that I almost didn't apply-- on the day the app was due, I had one more essay to write and was generally super not down to do it, so I almost quit altogether (so thanks Mom for yelling at me for 2 hours after I told you I wanted to not apply to Stanford haha)... and then I was going over my app and realized I almost submitted 2 of the same essay whoops... Anyway tl;dr I feel so blessed and privileged (and shocked) to have been accepted to such a fine institution-- Stanford 2019!!!

Decision: Accepted

                             
 
Objective: 
â¢ SAT I (breakdown): Almost 2300 (one sitting, junior year) 
â¢ ACT (breakdown): 35 (one sitting, junior year) 
â¢ SAT II: 800, 800 
â¢ Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 4.0 
â¢ Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): Top 1%âschool doesn't rank, but one of the top 3 students, possibly the top 
â¢ AP (place score in parentheses): Five 5's, two 4's (plus will take five more in May) 
â¢ Senior Year Course Load: Most rigorous possible (and beyond highest AP level in math and one other subject) 
â¢ Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): Yes, with very large financial award 
 
Subjective: 
â¢ Extracurriculars (place leadership in parentheses): Two main ECs, one unique and the other typical (both involving leadership) 
â¢ Job/Work Experience: Yes, extensive, paid, and unique 
â¢ Volunteer/Community service: Yes, extensive and unique 
â¢ Summer Activities: One short summer program each year (1-3 weeks), plus work involving unique EC each summer 
â¢ Essays: Very good, and main one was unique 
â¢ Teacher Recommendation: Didn't seeâprobably great 
â¢ Counselor Rec: Didn't seeâprobably great 
â¢ Additional Rec: Yesâgreat, and from foremost person in the world qualified to address unique EC activities 
â¢ Interview: No Stanford interview because we live in California, but great elsewhereâall interviewers were fascinated by and focused on unique EC 
â¢ Supplementary Material: Yesâexamples of unique EC 
 
Other 
â¢ Applied for Financial Aid?: Yes 
â¢ State (if domestic applicant): California 
â¢ School Type: Very large public school 
â¢ Ethnicity: White 
â¢ Gender: Male 
â¢ Income Bracket(mention if FA candidate): Upper middle class 
â¢ Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): None (except unique EC) 
 
Reflection 
â¢ Strengths: Unique, extremely well-developed EC outside of high school 
â¢ Weaknesses: Only a couple of EC's at high school (little time because of outside commitments) 
â¢ Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Unique EC (with top level of achievement possible, either for a teenager or an adult, in various areas)âknow this for a fact 
â¢ Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to Harvard, Yale (early), Princeton, and Stanfordâchose Stanford 
 
General Comments: I filled this out for my son, who preferred not to have all details posted, including a fifth top-tier private school he was accepted to. My advice:  Be yourself; follow your "passion" (if you have oneâif not, don't fake it); take the most rigorous course load you can; get top grades; do well on the SAT and/or ACT (aim for 2250+ on former and 35+ on latter, but no matter what, don't take either one more than twice!); enter local, state, national, and international competitions and hope to place in some; don't worry if you're not an athlete; don't get your heart set on one or two schoolsâkeep in mind that you can be happy and successful anywhere. My son had several other less-than-top-tier schools he was very interested in and would have been happy to attendâand, because of his EC, we (his parents) actually wondered whether he should put off college or even skip it altogether. But he really wanted to go, and we think he'll get a lot out of it (though it will slow down his EC career, as high school did). Please don't private message me asking for further details about his EC, since he would prefer to keep that information confidential. Good luck, everyoneâeven with his outcome, we found this process very stressful and difficult, right up to and including making the final decision about which school to attend. The good news is, no matter where you end up, you'll be happy the college admissions process is over!

Summer Activities: Origami, Guitar, Piano, Running. 
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 
 
Favorite Books, etc: 7 or 8/10. Kept it simple. 
 
What I enjoy: 6-7/10, once again simple and honest. Math based (numberphile, youtube watching) 
 
Significant Challenge: 8/10, talked about how the infinite potential of nuclear development and the desire for power can cause disaster, and how science today is contributing primarily to developing weapons of mass destruction. 
 
Spending summers: 6/10, made short points about various activities (internship, vacations, running, origami, music) 
 
Favorite Events: 7/10 
 
Historical Moment:8/10 
 
Intellectual Vitality essay: 8.5/10. Talked about how one of my teachers can do a certain odd math trick and how that intrigued me. Used it as a basis to convey my passion for math. 
 
Letter to Roomate: 10/10. Used different scientific and mathematical principles to describe myself and my anticipated future activities at Stanford. 
 
What Matters to You and Why: I'm not entirely sure how this essay was received. It's probably what turned off admissions. I wrote about how my parents wanted me to be a doctor, but I decided to be an engineer. Then I talked about individuality and why it matters to me. I thought it was like a 7/10 when I submitted it, but looking back its more like a 6/10. 
 
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 10/10 for both Math and AP US teachers. Great recs,

Reflection: Honestly, Stanford is a very selective school and I was down to have not gotten in, but later I realized it may have not been the best fit for me. I got into Cornell and plan to go there, so I'm excited and was able to get over my rejection. Applying to Stanford was a great experience. 
 
Strengths: Good SAT, academics, some essays were good. 
Weaknesses: Awkward "what matters to you essay", maybe didn't have enough international competition awards (still have no idea how people get those) 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: It's very competitive and can be arbitrary at times. Many people who assume they won't get in will get in, and many who think they have a good chance end up getting rejected. It's a part of the process lol. 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: 
Accepted: GIT, RPI, RIT, Cornell 
Waitlisted, later rejected: MIT, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon. Waitlisted UPenn but didn't accept waitlist. 
Rejected: Princeton, Stanford.

Congratulations to all of you who were accepted, you guys will do great things at Stanford! I'm not disappointed by the decision, actually, despite waiting in anticipation. Especially after reading the letter that they sent to us who were rejected, I really don't feel so bad. And for all of you who were rejected, remember one thing:   And one last thing: Don't give up, just keep moving forward. Please take the time to read the letter written by the Dean, it's inspirational. Congratulations once again to all of you who have been accepted to Stanford!

General Comments:[/noparse] 
I am VERY shocked that I got waitlisted, considering how many qualified people applied. I made a CC account just to post this and give people hope that normal people do in fact have a chance of attending a top college. If you were like me, you may have spent hours reading CC and got depressed at how many people with 2300+ SAT scores and countless ECs got rejected. Please take this advice to heart: DO NO JUDGE YOUR WORTH ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE. They may have had more resources and easier environments growing up. Regardless though, always strive to do what you can in your given circumstances. You will get into a good college somewhere else, and at the end of the day, it is what you do with your time in college and not the college itself that allows you to succeed.  Be honest in your application, especially in questions that ask you about your favorite things, because honesty is what really shines through an application and college padding and pretentiousness are easy to spot. Good luck to future applicants and remember to always try your best no matter what.

Teacher Recommendation: Latin and History teachers - both showed to me and I felt they were pretty much ideal!!! I honestly even found them touching - both teachers have known me since I was at least 14 
 
Counselor Rec: I used my head of year as a counselor since we don't really have them in British schools! She also used to teach me Latin. She wouldn't let me see the reference itself, but the teacher has known me for 7 years, and she led an world challenge expedition that I took part in through school - I think she could write pretty well about me from these experiences

Weaknesses: I felt my Math SAT component was low but apparently it didn't hold me back!!! I just honestly thought the competition was far too tough for people like me to stand a chance 
 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/denied: I honestly could not say, and the fact that this is just one of a lot of acceptances baffles me all the more ahhhhhhhhhhhh

General Comments: 
I hate to be cliche, but future applicants: don't ever give up! People told me I couldn't get in to any HYPSM school. My parents, some friends, and worst of all myself. And here I am with my dream school Stanford, and other great acceptances. 
The odds were stacked against me: Asian... NJ... low GPA...sparse leadership positions...other great applicants from my school. But I just worked with what I had, put it all I had on the line, tried my hardest, and it paid off. 
Also I'm sure it's the essays that helped me get in. I worked so hard on them, I would stay up late into the night trying new drafts and perfecting them. 
When you want something really bad and you work hard enough, it is possible to get it.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think my internship and aquarium volunteer experience had a lot to do with it. Those are with pretty prestigious institutions. I also put a ton of passion into improving my school's music program, so much so that my teacher recommenders noticed and validated it in their letters. 
 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to UC Berkeley, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Irvine, Santa Cruz, Davis, Cal Poly, Santa Clara. Waitlisted at UCLA (lol) 
 
General Comments: Can't wait to go! I still can't get over the shock and I never thought that this would really happen. Future Stanford applicants, start thinking about it early and strategically plan out your essays to cover lots different stuff and make yourself as interesting as possible. If it's your clear first choice, I recommend applying early as long as you can have your ducks in a row by October. That way, you'll be out of direct competition with fellow classmates at your school (assuming few others apply early) and if you are deferred you'll have a leg up on those who apply regular.

General Comments: Guys, dreams do come true. Thank you, College Confidential Community, for being such a support through the years. You are part of the reason I got into Stanford. To those who were denied admission, I totally empathize with you - all the ivies denied me too and I was so depressed with life, believing I had no chance at Stanford. During my time in limbo, I cried, mulled, and kept asking why why why why why....? And I realized that it ultimately wouldn't matter where I went, as long as I had a direction in my heart. Most of the world's most successful people like Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs didn't need the Ivies or Stanford to change the world, because they had the passion and drive to succeed, which is ultimately what is matters. And that starts with you. Of course I can't complain - Stanford is definitely a great platform and I am so humbled to have gotten in, but I also realize that my undergraduate education should not define me, even if that undergraduate education IS Stanford, one of the best schools in the world. So I guess in parting, rejects: don't get down on yourself; there is a full life ahead of you and once your make millions, it won't even matter where you went to college. Waitlist peeps: Keep your head up in case Stanford calls you, but be realistic at the same time so you go to college next year. Admits: Congrats! We made it! It's be a wonderful rollercoaster of a journey and I am so glad it's over. Time to change the world   (btw if you need help with essays, definitely check out ****.co. They have real essays that worked!) 
 
NB: I was deferred before but accepted now. It was really depressing at first but I realized it was an opportunity to really showcase myself (even though I got a fricken B first semester of senior year). But passion trumps everything - do what you love because you love it, not because colleges "think" it's cool. Here's a great article for future deferees:  
 
Peace out homies

  Will not be taking the waitlist spot haha someone else can have it. I'm probably going to Davis for financial reasons. Also I was not at all expecting a waitlist! It's a pleasant surprise that they think I'm worth at least some time, and I think its proof that normal people have a chance. Congrats to those who got in, don't worry to those who didn't. It's gonna be ok, you're gonna be happy.

However, I think these students cannot be deterred from succeeding regardless of rejections and setbacks.

Senior Year Course Load: AP Government, AP Statistics, AP Literature, AP Psychology, AP Physics B, and Student Gov. 
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): Nothing major. AP Scholar with Distinction, Torch of Excellence in U.S. History, 3rd in District Rotary Speech Competition 
 
 
 
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Whiteboard Education (Founder and Developer,  , 3,000 students registered), The Investing Academy (Founder and Developer,  , over 14,000 users worldwide + top ranked iPhone app in Finance), Student Government (Technology Director), National Honor Society (Tutoring Coordinator), Model United Nations (Secretary General), Mock Trial (Prosecution Attorney), Speech and Debate (Treasurer) 
 
Job/Work Experience: Paid Engineering Intern at Quip ( ). Moved up to SF, rented an apartment, and lived and worked on my own throughout the summer. Developed the core "mentions" feature of the Quip app, which allows you to link documents, users, and folders together in threads. 
 
Volunteer/Community service: Organized after school tutoring weekly and developed an entire online tutoring system (part of the "Whiteboard" project), with a free National Honor Society tutor available in any subject. 
 
Summer Activities: Summer Internship @ Quip and Living in San Francisco, Teaching Myself To Code, Developing Whiteboard and The Investing Academy 
 
Essays: 
 
  - What drove me to develop Whiteboard and how originally it was a catastrophic failure, but how I grew and learned from it and turned it around years later. Honestly this one went through so many revisions that eventually it lost my voice and sounded generic. (6/10) 
 
 : Explaining what Investing Academy was and how it grew to have worldwide impact, and how we used it on campus. This too lost my natural voice as I was trying to fit so much into 150 characters. (6/10) 
 
 : How I first learned to code, as it was pretty unconventional (no KhanAcademy or edX at the time). Described more my philosophy towards learning. It had some typos though, and may have come off as naive. (6/10) 
 
 : How my desk and my notebook reflect who I am and how I think. This was my personal favorite. (8/10) 
 
 : How, as an agnostic, I derive meaning in impact in change, and how that relates to everything I have done, especially in technology. Probably the best Stanford essay I did. (8/10) 
 
Teacher Recommendations: 
 
  - Most likely very good. He knew me the most personally and academically (got the academic award in his class, after all), and was also my MUN advisor, helping me increase membership 5x and take us to our first conference. He does write TONS of letters though, so theres a chance it was generic, and I wouldn't blame him though. 
 
  - Unsure, hope it was good! I didn't know her very personally, but was a top student in her class. 
 
Counselor Rec: Should be pretty good! Didn't know each other very personally, but have been talking to her and getting advice since freshman year. Also did a lot of tech. stuff for the guidance office, and she wanted to write about the impact Whiteboard has had on our campus. 
 
Additional Rec: Fantastic. From Bret Taylor, the CEO of Quip and Ex-CTO of Facebook (also, inventor of Google Maps). I got to know him pretty well over the summer, and he thought I was better than any college-level intern he's had at Facebook or Google. Also, being an alumni of the Stanford CS department always helps  
 
Interview: CA Resident, so my interview was waived. 
 
 
 
State (if domestic applicant): CA 
School Type: Public 
Race: Iranian 
Hispanic (Y/N): N 
Gender: M 
Income Bracket: $130,000-$140,000 
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Internship in Silicon Valley, Whiteboard 
 
 
 
Strengths: Definitely my EC's. A lot of CS projects that showed my passion, initiative, and determination. My grades and coursework were very strong too. Also my letters of rec. I think were great overall. 
 
Weaknesses: Test scores (pretty low for Stanford, at least) and essays 
 
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: My extracurriculars (esp. Whiteboard and my internship at Quip), and the personal vision I portrayed in my essays. 
 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Waitlisted at Dartmouth, Princeton, MIT, and Harvard. 
 
General Comments: I found out yesterday, and the excitement has far from worn off (I'm finally calm enough to type this out though). After getting waitlisted by all the Ivy's I didn't even think this was a possibility. Stanford's been the dream for such a long time, and getting in is still surreal. My only advice would be to do what your passionate about - Stanford will notice. Also, spend as much time as possible on your essays, but don't freak out if you don't feel their not perfect. Mine where somewhat generic and even had a few typos, and I was freaking out the last three months thinking I blew it. As long as your essays convey who you are and what you want do in life, Stanford is within your reach. 
 
I've been lurking for the last four years, but made this account just to post. If you're a future applicant reading this, I hope it helped somehow, and good luck! It's been good CollegeConfidential. Time to finally move forward.                           Post edited by roozbehmahdavian on

                            Socalpapa - Sorry! I should have caught that error. I copied my post almost exactly from another RD decisions thread, and while I did remember to change some Stanford-specific things, I missed the detail about my ACT. Yes you're correct - I did send my ACT to Stanford, and I sent it to Brown too, however those were the only 2 schools.

Essays: In my opinion, really, really good. It'd make for some great sample essays in the typical "How to Write A College Essay" book. Too bad they apparently weren't persuasive enough. I thought the essays had more weight than that.

Counselor Rec: Haven't seen the counselor rec 
Additional Rec: None 
Interview: The interview went well. The interviewer was an engineering major and we really "clicked" on a lot of topics. It couldn't have gone better.

General Comments: College admissions does NOT favor the late-bloomers. (I might write up a thread about this.) I was a freakin' introvert freshman and sophomore years and neglected to try new things. The result? The best I could be was a boring applicant with great test scores. I wish I could travel back in time and tell myself to snap out of my introverted shell and do stuff like get elected to the student council or join speech and debate, but now I only have the future to look forward to. Anyways, congrats to those admitted.

Everyone has a chance, just apply to see what happens. For the ivies, make sure you spread yourself and do not apply to just a few schools, because they are so random. Kinda annoyed that the legacy didn't get me in because I thought that I was a competitive applicant but I guess that being legacy does not actually help that much.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I showed passion for what I want to do and related that passion to Stanford.  I also think that Stanford appreciates hard work and by sharing my town's demographics in my essay I think they got a sense of "wow this kid started from the bottom now he's here." 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Ohio State University (accepted), Ohio University (accepted), University of Dayton (accepted), New York University (accepted), Georgetown University (accepted). 
 
General Comments:  I still haven't committed to a school.  I was accepted to Georgetown EA and I really didn't even think Stanford would be an option.  GU and SU are definitely my top two but I have no idea which to choose.  I'm a bio/pre-med major by the way.

General Comments: YOU ARE MORE THAN YOUR GPA. Seriously, holistic admissions is a thing. If you had told me a year ago that I would have gotten into HYPS, I would have called you crazy. I just wanted to post my stats so that people see that it IS possible. I remember reading literally every decisions thread dating back to 2008 and getting completely heartbroken when I saw how many people had 4.0s and were STILL rejected. I would see some people who had sub-par stats and get in, but they ALWAYS had extremely high GPAs.

                            Decision: ACCEPTED!!!!  
 
Lol I never do these. This is simply to manifest the idea that you donât need a 2400 SAT, ostentatious international awards, or pretentious extracurriculars to be accepted into a great school. Simply be yourself, and the true individual will shine through. 
 
---OBJECTIVE--- 
 
SAT I: 2090 â 600 CR, 770 M, 720 W (11 Essay) from 3 sittings 
 
ACT: never took it and donât regret it 
 
SAT II: 530 USH, 620 Spanish, 650 Physics, 770 Math II 
 
Unweighted GPA: 4.0 
 
Class Rank: 4/334 
 
AP Scores: USH (2), English Lang (2), US Gov & Pol (3), Calc AB (4) â I didnât send any of them 
 
Senior Year Course Load: (all AP) â Bio, Lit, Spanish, Calc BC, and Psych + marching band 
 
Major Awards: HAH. I didnât win, nor have I ever HEARD of half of the stuff most of you have won. The only awards I put on the common app were the Junior Class Service Award, Academic Excellence (basically for showing up to school for four years and getting good grades), the Presidentâs Education Awards Program (same idea), a citation for service on the Maryland Youth Advisory Council, and a Superior (1) Rating at the MD State Solo & Ensemble Festival for flute 
 
---SUBJECTIVE--- 
 
Extracurriculars: I did a hell of a lot of stuff in school; unfortunately, the dreaded common app only offers place for 10 hahaha so these were the ones I found to be the most cohesive and âgoal-orientedâ â Rock nâ Roll Revival (9-12, musical production at my high school, itâs the biggest fundraiser we have and it annually brings in >$100,000), Symphonic and Marching Band (9-12, flute section leader, did AllShore and honors bands and what not), worked in my momâs pediatric office for 3 yrs, Key Club (10-12, Awards Historian 10th grade, President 12th grade), National Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta (10-12, President 12th grade), flute lessons with a university woodwind professor (11-12, I mentioned the International Flute Symposium I attended last summer at WVU), the Maryland Youth Advisory Council, Spanish Honor Society (10-12, President 12th grade) 
 
Job/Work Experience: marching band basically is a job hahah but I kinda already mentioned the doctorâs office 
 
Volunteer/Community Service: I was honestly terrified that this would be my demise. I only managed 270-300ish when most of my friends are up in the 600-800 range, with some up in the stratosphere (2000-3000s) I donât even know how thatâs humanly possible. I worked hard and was very active with Key Club and I really turned it around senior year. I think that, despite not having an astronomical amount of hours, really helped me. 
 
Summer Activities: Jesus Christ you people are mighty specific! Other than working, pretty much the symposium and marching band (and ardently practicing the flute, of course   But aside from that, I do actually have a life and I sleep until 3pm on weekdays and I stay out until 4am with my friends all weekend  
 
Essays: I was the proudest of my Stanford essays of all the colleges I applied to. 
1.) Common App: Wrote the failure essay and talked about how being rejected from All State Band for 4 years     really opened my eyes and made me realize that I am NOT the best flute player around, and thatâs okay. I entitled it âAll State Bannedâ and that was just pure gold; I pat myself on the back for that. (8/10) 
2.) Extracurricular: wrote about marching band and the sense of unity cus everyone knows that we are a cult incognito haha (7/10) 
3.) Intellectual Vitality: I wrote about a time when I was coming out of my lesson and I heard this kid playing âTwinkle Twinkle Litter Starâ on violin and he kept missing one of the intervals. He kept going until he got it right, and it showed me that if he can persevere, then all of us can. (8/10) 
4.) Letter to Roomate: This was the best essay by far. I really just spoke from the heart and tried to be funny. I talked about all my little quirks and how Iâd probably be up at 3am watching the Berlin Philharmonic and how Iâd never see my roommate because Iâd always be in a practice room or a lab somewhere haha I also made sure to mention specific buildings on campus. One line was like âIf you want to talk, we can always meet up at CoHoâ one of the coffee shops on campus at Stanford. I also mad a reference to Jordan Hall (the building that houses the psychology department), so I think they really saw that I wanted the SCHOOL and not just the prestige. (169023/10 Iâm sorry, I was just really really REALLY proud of this essay) 
5.) What Matters: I talked about Spanish (and wrote it in Spanish, I really think that blew them away). I said itâs important that every person learn a second language in order to show others that youâre open to the challenge of learning a new culture. (9/10) 
 
Recommendations: I got one from my AP Lang teacher to justify that I am a good writer and deserved a 5 on the exam. I got the other from my 10th grade English teacher. I went on a trip to Italy with her and 10ish other students last summer so she really got to know me on a personal level. The last was from my band director. I really only asked him because Iâd known one person who graduated like 6 or 7 years ago whom he wrote a recc for and he got into Stanford. I DID read his and it was the most beautiful recommendation Iâd ever seen (his was the additional recc that I personally mailed). 
 
Couselor Recc: idk and idc 
 
Interview: The closest ones were in DC so I didn't interview haha but I guess it doesnât really matter since I got in anyways 
 
---OTHER--- 
 
State: MD priddeeee!!! 
 
Country: USA 
 
School Type: public 
 
Race: African American 
 
Gender: male 
 
Income bracket: $100,000-$120,000ish (they didnât give me any financial aid) ï 
 
Hooks: I donât like to say that my race is a âhookâ, but I definitely think it played a role in the decision. 
 
---REFLECTION--- 
 
Strengths: essays and character, I really didnât care about numbers; the person who they were evaluating was a lot more important to me. I really tried to manifest that idea in the application. 
 
Weaknesses: Good Lord, my test scores were a joke hahahahha and the community service was on the low side. âLack of major awardsâ is not a weakness, fyi. 
 
Why you think you were accepted: Honestly, who knows. The 5% that were accepted probably donât have a clue. I just told myself to be myself and everything would work out okay. THAT and the fact that Iâm a black Spanish speaking male flute player that wants to be a music therapist hahaha I guess thatâs pretty unique. 
 
Where else you were accepted: 
 
Accepted: Brown, Cornell, Georgia Tech, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, Oberlin College & Conservatory (flute performance woohoo!!), Salisbury University, Stanford, Syracuse, the University of Miami and the Frost School of Music, Virginia Tech, and a full ride to UMD College Park 
 
Rejected: Peabody Conservatory of Music, and Harvard after SCEA deferral 
 
General Comments: Honestly, you guys stress yourselves out WAAAYYYY too much. Getting on forums like these freaking out if your decision doesnât come 17 seconds after the posted time? Itâs a little ridiculous. Iâm sure youâre all highly intelligent kids, much more than myself, but scores and grades are only a small portion of this. The admissions committee is a group of people who have emotions, not robots that throw away apps that have a <2200 SAT score. Do yourselves a favor, and just relax. To those who were accepted, I congratulate you on your accomplisments, and I cannot wait to meet you in the fall. To those that were waitlisted, if you got waitlisted from Stanford, you probably were accepted to some pretty nice places, so consider your great options! And to those of you who were rejected, itâs not the end of the world. Stanford is 1 of the hundreds of colleges in the US and the thousands in the entire world. You will find a place where you belong.
