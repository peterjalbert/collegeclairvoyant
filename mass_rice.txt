[ *]Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I simply wouldn't be a good fit at Rice. Furthermore, I didn't demonstrate interest... I had no interview and had no visit or contact with Rice. Also, Rice cares a lot about cumulative GPA, and my ninth grade really hurt there.

[ *]Where else have you been admitted/rejected/waitlisted: Accepted: UChicago, UMDCP, Emory U, UMBC, GaTech, UCLA, UC Berkeley   Waitlisted: Vanderbilt   Rejected: Rice



[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!




 Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering





















Congrats to everyone else who was accepted, and to those who weren't, you'll have other amazing options!

 Computer Science/Engineering and Pyschology


























 I believe everyone should just be themselves in their application process and the right school for you will accept you in time. Every university seems to look for different qualities in their students, so don't be too disappointed if [insert *dream* school] doesn't treasure your qualities - others definitely will.

[ *]Why you think you were accepted: It's hard to say. I have strong academics and although I don't have as many leadership positions as other people, I put much more of my effort and time into those few clubs. However, nothing extraordinary like Siemens. No internships. No papers published.

UT Austin, A&M, UC San Diego, accepted

Waiting from UPenn, Columbia, and Harvard (likely will all get rejected)



[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

 I think it's important to show a strong interest in a concentrated area rather than trying for a little of everything - if you can do both, that's great, but I think that having some sort of focus gives a better idea of who you are.

For sometime, I thought I really wanted to go to Rice - it's an amazing school. At this point, I know that I'm probably going to Cornell, Berkeley or Northwestern (It's just a matter of choosing).

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:



College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.                        

                            Decision: Accepted



I hope this helps someone!

Schools you were rejected from? Just Rice, haha

Schools you are waiting for? n/a.  FINALLY DONE WAITING GOD BLESS

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)



Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Physics C, AP Macroeconomics (1st semester), AP US Government (2nd semester), Advanced Anatomy and Physiology, AP Environmental Science, one off period



Our school district splits AP Calc BC and AB into 2 years, which is why I took both AB and BC

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

 I think it's important to show a strong interest in a concentrated area rather than trying for a little of everything - if you can do both, that's great, but I think that having some sort of focus gives a better idea of who you are.

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)



Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Physics C, AP Macroeconomics (1st semester), AP US Government (2nd semester), Advanced Anatomy and Physiology, AP Environmental Science, one off period



Our school district splits AP Calc BC and AB into 2 years, which is why I took both AB and BC

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

 I think it's important to show a strong interest in a concentrated area rather than trying for a little of everything - if you can do both, that's great, but I think that having some sort of focus gives a better idea of who you are. It's in the essays that I would try to show versatility.

For sometime, I thought I really wanted to go to Rice - it's an amazing school. At this point, I know that I'm probably going to Cornell, Berkeley or Northwestern (It's just a matter of choosing).

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:



College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.                        

                            Decision: Accepted



I hope this helps someone!

Schools you were rejected from? Just Rice, haha

Schools you are waiting for? n/a.  FINALLY DONE WAITING GOD BLESS

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)



Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Physics C, AP Macroeconomics (1st semester), AP US Government (2nd semester), Advanced Anatomy and Physiology, AP Environmental Science, one off period



Our school district splits AP Calc BC and AB into 2 years, which is why I took both AB and BC

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!




 Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering





















Congrats to everyone else who was accepted, and to those who weren't, you'll have other amazing options!

 Computer Science/Engineering and Pyschology


























 I believe everyone should just be themselves in their application process and the right school for you will accept you in time. Every university seems to look for different qualities in their students, so don't be too disappointed if [insert *dream* school] doesn't treasure your qualities - others definitely will.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

 I think it's important to show a strong interest in a concentrated area rather than trying for a little of everything - if you can do both, that's great, but I think that having some sort of focus gives a better idea of who you are. It's in the essays that I would try to show versatility.

Reflection

For sometime, I thought I really wanted to go to Rice - it's an amazing school. At this point, I know that I'm probably going to Cornell, Berkeley or Northwestern (It's just a matter of choosing).

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:



College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.                        

                            Decision: Accepted



I hope this helps someone!

Reflection

Strengths: idk

Weaknesses: i didn't show interest and essay game too weak

Schools were you accepted/waitlisted to? Accepted for first choice major (either ChemE or a different engineering major if ChemE wasn't available): UCSD, UCD, UCSB, UCI, UMich, UT Austin, USC, UMN-TC, UIUC, Cal Poly SLO, SJSU, other schools not even worth mentioning; Accepted to Berkeley in the college of L&S; Waitlisted at UCLA

Schools you were rejected from? Just Rice, haha

Schools you are waiting for? n/a.  FINALLY DONE WAITING GOD BLESS

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)



Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Physics C, AP Macroeconomics (1st semester), AP US Government (2nd semester), Advanced Anatomy and Physiology, AP Environmental Science, one off period



Our school district splits AP Calc BC and AB into 2 years, which is why I took both AB and BC

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!




 Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering





















Congrats to everyone else who was accepted, and to those who weren't, you'll have other amazing options!

 Computer Science/Engineering and Pyschology


























 I believe everyone should just be themselves in their application process and the right school for you will accept you in time. Every university seems to look for different qualities in their students, so don't be too disappointed if [insert *dream* school] doesn't treasure your qualities - others definitely will.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

Reflection

For sometime, I thought I really wanted to go to Rice - it's an amazing school. At this point, I know that I'm probably going to Cornell, Berkeley or Northwestern (It's just a matter of choosing). Even if I had been accepted, I probably wouldn't be going here so it's definitely okay. Congratulations to everyone who got in!! This school rocks! Good luck to future applicants.

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:



College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.                        

                            Decision: Accepted



I hope this helps someone!

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!




 Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering





















Congrats to everyone else who was accepted, and to those who weren't, you'll have other amazing options!

 Computer Science/Engineering and Pyschology


























 I believe everyone should just be themselves in their application process and the right school for you will accept you in time. Every university seems to look for different qualities in their students, so don't be too disappointed if [insert *dream* school] doesn't treasure your qualities - others definitely will.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

 I think it's important to show a strong interest in a concentrated area rather than trying for a little of everything - if you can do both, that's great, but I think that having some sort of focus gives a better idea of who you are.

For sometime, I thought I really wanted to go to Rice - it's an amazing school. At this point, I know that I'm probably going to Cornell, Berkeley or Northwestern (It's just a matter of choosing).

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:



College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.                        

                            Decision: Accepted



I hope this helps someone!

Schools you were rejected from? Just Rice, haha

Schools you are waiting for? n/a.  FINALLY DONE WAITING GOD BLESS

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)



Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Physics C, AP Macroeconomics (1st semester), AP US Government (2nd semester), Advanced Anatomy and Physiology, AP Environmental Science, one off period



Our school district splits AP Calc BC and AB into 2 years, which is why I took both AB and BC

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.

[ *]Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I simply wouldn't be a good fit at Rice. Furthermore, I didn't demonstrate interest... I had no interview and had no visit or contact with Rice. Also, Rice cares a lot about cumulative GPA, and my ninth grade really hurt there.

[ *]Where else have you been admitted/rejected/waitlisted: Accepted: UChicago, UMDCP, Emory U, UMBC, GaTech, UCLA, UC Berkeley   Waitlisted: Vanderbilt   Rejected: Rice



[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!

Congrats to everyone else who was accepted, and to those who weren't, you'll have other amazing options!

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

 I think it's important to show a strong interest in a concentrated area rather than trying for a little of everything - if you can do both, that's great, but I think that having some sort of focus gives a better idea of who you are. It's in the essays that I would try to show versatility.

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.

Schools you were rejected from? Just Rice, haha

Schools you are waiting for? n/a.  FINALLY DONE WAITING GOD BLESS

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)



Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Physics C, AP Macroeconomics (1st semester), AP US Government (2nd semester), Advanced Anatomy and Physiology, AP Environmental Science, one off period



Our school district splits AP Calc BC and AB into 2 years, which is why I took both AB and BC

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

 I think it's important to show a strong interest in a concentrated area rather than trying for a little of everything - if you can do both, that's great, but I think that having some sort of focus gives a better idea of who you are. It's in the essays that I would try to show versatility.

For sometime, I thought I really wanted to go to Rice - it's an amazing school. At this point, I know that I'm probably going to Cornell, Berkeley or Northwestern (It's just a matter of choosing).

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:



College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.                        

                            Decision: Accepted



I hope this helps someone!

Schools you were rejected from? Just Rice, haha

Schools you are waiting for? n/a.  FINALLY DONE WAITING GOD BLESS

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)



Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Physics C, AP Macroeconomics (1st semester), AP US Government (2nd semester), Advanced Anatomy and Physiology, AP Environmental Science, one off period



Our school district splits AP Calc BC and AB into 2 years, which is why I took both AB and BC

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]



I was simply not a good fit for Rice... It was better that I was rejected, and my spot given to someone else who would truly thrive at Rice, than for me to be accepted to a university I'd be unlikely to attend.

I've received generous merit aid from UChicago, and I think I would most likely attend there anyways. This decision was for the best!                        

                            



I hope this helps someone!




 Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering





















Congrats to everyone else who was accepted, and to those who weren't, you'll have other amazing options!

 Computer Science/Engineering and Pyschology


























 I believe everyone should just be themselves in their application process and the right school for you will accept you in time. Every university seems to look for different qualities in their students, so don't be too disappointed if [insert *dream* school] doesn't treasure your qualities - others definitely will.

[ b]General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:[ /b][/noparse]

Your admissions decision depends on what state you're from and what major you applied to. I applied Biomedical Engineering to all my colleges except Wash U. (biology), which was probably a big mistake, because of their BME programs are incredibly good...so yeah, big mistake. UPenn is a big business school and my friend said she knew some people who wanted to get into business at UPenn, but instead they applied to different majors and waited until they got in before transferring to business. Wish I knew that beforehand...

 I think it's important to show a strong interest in a concentrated area rather than trying for a little of everything - if you can do both, that's great, but I think that having some sort of focus gives a better idea of who you are. It's in the essays that I would try to show versatility.

Reflection

For sometime, I thought I really wanted to go to Rice - it's an amazing school. At this point, I know that I'm probably going to Cornell, Berkeley or Northwestern (It's just a matter of choosing).

+ Trustee Distinguished Scholarship




























 Honestly, before admissions decisions were released, I saw the 'waitlist update' option on the drop down menu and pretty much gave up. I'm still kind of in shock, since this has been one of my top schools since forever, and I would've considered just getting in a dream. The scholarship was completely unexpected, and I didn't even know it existed beforehand. And after a lot of waitlists from more selective schools, I wasn't too optimistic, but barring a miracle Tuesday, I'm headed to Rice!



I think it's most important to take all the waitlists and rejections in stride, since these admissions officers ultimately know who fits their school best (and more and more people apply each year). It's been a long and often painful process, but I think in the end everything will work out fine as long as you approach it with an open mind.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:



College decisions sometimes feels like they're just throwing darts at a board and picking who it lands on so I guess don't get too down about certain decisions. Some good schools are bound to accept you and you never know which school you'll end up liking the most. Anyway, don't stress too much especially if you're still waiting for decisions! Be excited instead.                        

                            Decision: Accepted



I hope this helps someone!

Reflection

Strengths: idk

Weaknesses: i didn't show interest and essay game too weak

Schools were you accepted/waitlisted to? Accepted for first choice major (either ChemE or a different engineering major if ChemE wasn't available): UCSD, UCD, UCSB, UCI, UMich, UT Austin, USC, UMN-TC, UIUC, Cal Poly SLO, SJSU, other schools not even worth mentioning; Accepted to Berkeley in the college of L&S; Waitlisted at UCLA

Schools you were rejected from? Just Rice, haha

Schools you are waiting for? n/a.  FINALLY DONE WAITING GOD BLESS

General Comments: I sort of just applied to Rice to appease my parents in all honesty, so I'm glad I got rejected.  Congrats to everyone who got in!!                        

                            So this should officially ends my college admission adventure, except I'm still waiting for UPenn, which I believe is just another rejection.










  Natural Science -- Physics









I mentioned that I studied quite some physics (and the math that associated) on my own, and I'm basically working on the courses that I should take in my sophomore year (Quantum Mechanics in particular).But I guess I didn't emphasis that enough to cover up the weakness of my course load.



I also mentioned that I am a big fan in Rice's online courses (and have actually done their phys102 and phys201), and that's about all I did to show my interest in Rice...



























This rejection from Rice really frustrated me. Even my MIT rejection (MIT and Rice are equally my first choice) doesn't hurt me as much as this one, although that is partially because I know I got absolutely no chance in MIT anyway...



I wish I have make up my mind to Rice earlier and have put much more effort on my application. I really should have trash my QuestBridge app and just start all over to apply to Rice. But anyway, I have lost my chance forever.



Special thanks to the QuestBridge program for making me want to try to apply top schools like Rice, regardless of how weak I am as an applicant



And finally, congratulations to everyone who got in.

                        

                            Sorry I accidentally put "n/a" for my senior workload - I am post #9 (and post #8, I didn't really know what I was doing, but #9 should be the one that was formatted correctly)



Senior Year Course Load: AP Calculus BC, AP English Literature and Composition, AP Physics C, AP Macroeconomics (1st semester), AP US Government (2nd semester), Advanced Anatomy and Physiology, AP Environmental Science, one off period



Our school district splits AP Calc BC and AB into 2 years, which is why I took both AB and BC

Show other people your essays because their input is really helpful. Start on your applications early and don't let the senioritis kill you. Good luck to all!                         

                            





























I wouldn't rely on people's essay ratings; it really is so subjective. For me the best way to write was to open with an anecdote and weave in my thoughts. I usually opened with dialogue out of context to create a hook. I wrote a lot for fun in middle school and early high school, so I've developed a strong writing style. Practice until you find a rhythm you're comfortable with. Make sure it is your voice. I only got feedback from my mom, and I only sometimes took her suggestions.



Don't pick your extracurriculars because you think they will look good on your resume. I didn't do scholars bowl, debate, sports, or music like most driven kids at my school do. I did what I wanted, and I am very happy with my college results. Good luck!                        

                            Never done this before. Hopefully I'm doing this right.
